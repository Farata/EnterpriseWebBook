= Chapter 3. Mocking Up the Application «Save Sick Child»

The time has come to start working on our Web application Save Sick Child
that will supports donations to ill children. In this chapter we’ll take
care of the Web design and will create the first prototype of the Save a
Child site.

=== Introducing Balsamic Mockups

First, we’ll create a mockup (a.k.a. wireframes) - a set of images
depicting various views of our Save Sick Child application. The images may
contain comments in the form of callouts that briefly explain what
should change in a view if a user will make a certain action,
e.g. clicks on the button. You can also think of a UI of any application
as a set of states and the user’s action result in your application’s
transition from one state to the other. As nerds and mathematicians say
``UI of your application is a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine[finite state machine]'',
which at any given point of time is in one of the finite number of
states, for example, in the view state Donate Form.

Visualize yourself sitting in a cafeteria and drawing sketches of your
Web site on a napkin. Well, we’ll use an electronic napkin so to speak -
an excellent prototyping tool called http://balsamiq.com[Balsamic
Mockups]. This is an easy to use program. It gives you a working area
where you create a mockup of your future Web application by dragging and
dropping the required UI components from the toolbar onto the image of
the Web page (see Figure 3-1).

When the prototype is done, it can be saved as an image and sent to the
project owner. Another option is to export the Balsamiq project into
XML, and if both the project owner and Web designer have Balsamiq
installed, the can work on it in collaboration. For example, the
designer exports the current states of the project, the owner imports it
and makes corrections or comments, then exports it again and sends it
back to the designer.

The Project Owner Talks to a Web Designer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At this stage a Web designer talks to the project owner discussing the
required functionality and then creates the UI to be implemented by Web
developers. The artifacts given to developers by the designer vary
depending by the qualifications of the designer. This can be a set of
images representing different states of the UI with little callouts
explaining the navigation of the application. If the Web designer is
familiar with HTML and CSS, you may get a working prototype in the form
of HTML and CSS files, and this is exactly what we’ll create by the end
of this chapter.

This is what the project owner said to our designer, The Save Sick Child
Web site should allow people to make donations to the ill children. The
users should be able to find these children by selecting an area on the
map. The site should be integrated with a payment system, include a
video player and display statistics about the donors and recepients. The
site should include a simple chat room and have a simple integration
with Twitter and Facebook. The mockup should include three versions of
the UI supporting desktops, tablets, and smartphones.''* This is what
the project owner said to our designer,

The Web designer opened Balsamiq and started to work. She decided that
the main window will consist of four areas laid out vertically: 1. A
header with the logo and several navigation buttons 2. The main area
with the Donate support plus the video player 3. The area with the Find
Local Kid, statistics, and a chat room. 4. A footer with several
house-holding links plus the icons for Twitter and FaceBook.

The First Mockups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first deliverable of our Web designer depicted two states of the UI:
before and after clicking the button Donate Now. The Web designer
suggested that on the button click the Video Player would turn into a
small button revealing the donation form.

The project owner suggested that turning the video into a button may not
be a the best solution. We shouldn’t forget that the main goal of this
application is collecting donation, so they decided to move the video
player to the lower portion of the window. The next version of the
mockup looks as shown in Figure 3-4 and 3-5. The latter shows different
UI states should the user decide to log in.

Next comes authorization. The view states in this process are: 1. Not
Logged On 2. The Login Form 3. Wrong ID/Password 4. Forgot Password 5.
Successfully Logged On

The Web designer has to create a mockup for each of these states. The
project owner will review them and can return them back with some
comments. Figure 3-5 illustrates selected views from authorization. Due
to some miscommunication the Web designer assumed that unless the user
log on to the application, she won’t be able to see Save Sick Child. This
is clearly wrong as the process of making donations has to be as easy as
possible, and forcing the donor to log on may result in abandoning Save
a Child application by some people.

From the Mockup to HTML Prototype
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are lucky - our Web designer knows HTML and CSS. In this section
we’ll turn the still mockups into the first HTML prototype, which will
use only hard-coded data but the layout of the site will be done in CSS
and we’ll use HTML5 markup.

``In this book we assume that the users of our Save Sick Child site work
with the latest versions of Web Browsers FireFox, Safari, Google Chrome
and Internet Explorer. While in the real world Web developers need to
deal with finding workarounds to the unsupported CSS or HTML5 features
in the old browsers, the modern IDE generate HTML5 boilerplate code that
include large CSS files providing different solutions to older
browsers.''

Adding Styles With CSS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We’ve been using some CSS in short code samples from Chapter 2, and now
let’s apply styles to make Save Sick Child look as in the mockup.We’ve been
