== Chapter 11. Responsive Design: One Site Fits All

The chapter starts with a brief overview of different approaches to making the Web site to the mobile space. One of the approaches is having only one Web site for all devices. This approach is is called _Responsive Design_, and we'll modify the design of the Save Sick Child site to introduce different layouts for the desktop, tablet, and smartphone devices. By the end of this chapter the site Save Sick Child will
automatically change its layout based on the user's device without the losing any functionality.


=== One Code Base vs. Two

People responsible for developing a Web application that can run on both desktop and mobile platforms usually start with making an important decision: HTML5 or native? This book is not about native applications - we'll only review the hybrid applications in Chapter 14. But even if a decision was made in the favor of Web platform, the next question is if the desktop and mobile clients will use the same code or not.  

If you'll decide to go with separate versions of the Web applications, the Web server can be configured to perform redirection to the appropriate code. Web servers can do it based on the value of the `User-Agent` attribute of the HTTP request's header. For example, the mobile Web browsers of bbc.com deliver the content from different URLs and they look differently (see <<FIG11-1>> and <<FIG11-2>>). 

[[FIG11-1]]

The above version delivers more content that can be allocated nicely on the large desktop monitor or a tablet. But the mobile version minimizes substantially what's delivered to the client over potentially slower network to be displayed on a small screen.

Have you ever tried to share the link of the Web site from your iPhone? It's so easy! Just press the button and enter the email of the person to share the site with. Go to bbc.com (it'll be redirected) on your iPhone and share this link with someone. That person will receive the link http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/i/[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mobile/i], and if she's visit this site from the desktop it won't look pretty - try to enter this URL in your desktop browser to see for yourself.

In this chapter we'll discuss how to design Web applications that have one code base for both the mobile and the desktop versions.  The Save Sick Child application will have the same code but will present itself differently on desktop and mobile devices using responsive design and _CSS media queries_. This is not necessarily the better approach to having separate versions as with the bbc.com, but we'll talk about pros and cons of both approaches. 

Maintaining two different versions of the code requires more efforts than maintaining one: you need to have two sets of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Besides, most likely your Web application will use a  third-party JavaScript framework. At some point you may run into a bug and need to upgrade the mobile version to use the latest version of such frameworks, say jQuery. But the desktop version works just fine. In case of having two separate versions of the application you'll have to either upgrade jQuery and thoroughly test both mobile and desktop versions of Save Sick Child, or live with two different versions of the framework. Responsive design allows to have one version of everything.

On the other hand, with responsive design your users will be downloading unnecessary code - the CSS that include all versions of screen layouts and larger than needed images to be scaled by the Web browser.

Here comes the million dollar question, "When we talk about creating two different versions of the Web application, is it really two, twenty two, or maybe two hundred and twenty two?" How many different mobile devices are there today and will be there tomorrow?


==== How many User Agents are there

Let's spend a little more time discussing the HTTP header's attribute `User-Agent` that contains information about the user agent originating request. Should you decide to create several versions of the UI based on the value in the `User-Agent` field, you can refer to the Web site http://useragentstring.com[http://useragentstring.com]. It lists not two, but hundreds of strings representing possible content of the `User-Agent` attribute for lots of desktop and mobile devices. For example, <<FIG11-3>> shows how the `User-Agent` from the iPhone 5 string is reported and explained by useragentstring.com.

It's impossible to create different layout of your Web application for each user agent.
