== Introducing the jQuery Library

Until now, we've been using HTML, plain JavaScript, and CSS to create the Save The Child web application. In the real world, developers try to be more productive by using JavaScript libraries.

Libraries such as http://jqueryui.com/[jQuery Core] substantially minimize the amount of manual coding while programming the core functionality of a web application. The jQuery UI library offers widgets, animations, and advanced effects. The http://requirejs.org/[RequireJS] library is a module loader that allows you to modularize HTML5 applications. Hundreds of micro libraries are also available that can do just one thing and can be used à la carte (visit http://microjs.com[MicroJS] for details).(((jQuery library, minimizing manual coding with)))

Libraries are different from frameworks, which we discuss in <<developing_in_ext_js>>. Whereas frameworks force you to organize your code in a certain way, a library simply offers components that allow you to write less code.((("libraries, vs. frameworks")))(((frameworks, vs. libraries)))

This chapter presents the JavaScript library  http://jquery.com/[jQuery], or to be more precise, JQuery Core. About half of the top websites use jQuery (visit http://bit.ly/1uYqUF0[Built With] for the current statistics). jQuery is simple to use and doesn't require you to dramatically change the way you program for the Web. jQuery offers a helping hand with the tasks that most web developers need to deal with--for example, finding and manipulating DOM elements, processing browser events, and dealing with browser incompatibility, which makes your code more maintainable. Because jQuery is an extensible library, lots and lots of plug-ins have been created by developers from around the world, and all of them are available for free. If you can't find the plug-in that fits your need, you can create one yourself.((("JavaScript", "library", see="jQuery")))(((jQuery library, benefits of)))((("jQuery Core", see="jQuery")))

NOTE: The jQuery UI library is a close relative of jQuery Core. It's a set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of jQuery. You can find such widgets as Datepicker, Accordion, Slider, Tabs, and Autocomplete. jQuery UI will also help you add various interactions (for example, drag-and-drop) and effects (for example, adding CSS classes or animations) to your web pages. (jQuery Core also has some effects.) jQuery UI is built on top of jQuery Core and can't be used independently. jQuery UI is covered in the pass:[<emphasis><ulink role="orm:hideurl" url="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023159.do">jQuery UI</ulink></emphasis>] by Eric Sarrion (O'Reilly).(((jQuery UI library)))


NOTE: jQuery Mobile is yet another library built on top of jQuery Core. But this one is geared toward creating mobile applications. <<jquery_mobile>> covers jQuery Mobile in detail.(((jQuery Mobile)))

This chapter is not a detailed jQuery Core primer; jQuery books and http://api.jquery.com/[the online API documentation] provide a comprehensive explanation of jQuery. But we'll give you just enough information to understand how jQuery can be used. In <<programming_stc_with_jquery>>, we'll review the code of several versions of this application highlighting the benefits of using the jQuery library.  

=== Getting Started with jQuery

At the time of this writing, you can download either jQuery version 1.9 or jQuery 2.0 (the latter doesn't support Internet Explorer 6, 7, or 8). You can download one of two distributions of jQuery. The Gzipped minified version of jQuery is 33 KB in size (it's 93 KB if unzipped), and this is all you need unless you are planning to develop jQuery plug-ins, in which case get the larger development version (it's about 270 KB). We've downloaded jQuery from http://www.jquery.com[jquery.com] and included it in the `<script>` tag in our HTML code samples so you can run them even if an Internet connection is not available.(((jQuery library, downloading))) 

But instead of deploying the jQuery framework on your servers as a part of your application, you should use a common content delivery network (CDN) URL in your HTML, as shown in the code that follows. Because jQuery is an extremely popular library, many websites use it. If more than one web page were to get it from the same CDN, the web browser would cache it locally and reuse it rather than downloading a separate copy from different servers for every web application that uses jQuery. The http://jquery.com/download/[download page of jquery.com] offers three CDNs: Google, Microsoft, and Media Temple.(((jQuery library, deployment)))((("content delivery network (CDN)"))) For example, if you don't need to use HTTPS with your application, Media Temple's CDN will suffice:

[source, html]
----
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
----

TIP: Using a CDN can have another advantage: the content (jQuery, in this case) is distributed around the globe and might be served to the user from servers located in the same city/country, thus reducing the latency. 

You can provide a fallback URL by adding one extra line that will load jQuery from an alternative location if your CDN fails:

[source, html]
----
<script> window.jQuery || document.write('<script 
      src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>')
</script>
----

WARNING: You may find code samples that use the URL http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js to download the latest version of jQuery. But keep in mind that by doing this, you might run into a situation in which some of the API of jQuery has been changed or deprecated. For example, jQuery 2.0 http://blog.jquery.com/2012/07/01/jquery-1-9-and-2-0-tldr-edition/[stopped supporting] Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8 and automatically switching to the latest version may result in malfunctioning of your application. We recommend using the specific version that has been tested with your application.

After covering the basics of jQuery Core, we are going to continue reviewing the code of a series of projects representing the same Save The Child application, but this time using jQuery. Other than adding validation to the Donate form and using an image slider, this application remains the same as in <<using_ajax_and_json>>; we just want to show that developers can be more productive in achieving the same result.

Some say that anyone who knows HTML can easily learn jQuery, but this is not so. Understanding JavaScript is required (see the bonus online chapter for reference).  Programming with  jQuery components starts with invoking the jQuery constructor `jQuery()`. But people use the shorter version of this constructor that's represented by a $ sign: `$()`. This `$` property is the only object that jQuery will create in the global namespace. Everything else will be encapsulated inside the `$` object.(((jQuery library, vs. HTML)))(((global namespace)))  

[NOTE]
====
Although it's easier to write `$()` than `jQuery()`, keep in mind that if you decide to use another library in your application in addition to jQuery, the chances are higher that you will run into a conflict with having another `$` than another `jQuery` in the global namespace. To make sure you won't find yourself in the "Another day, another $" position, put your code inside a closure, passing it `jQuery`.((("$() constructor")))((("jQuery library", "$() vs. jQuery() constructors"))) The following code allows you to safely use the `$` object:

[source, javascript]
----
(function($){
   // Your code goes here	
})(jQuery);
----
====

As you remember, JavaScript functions do not require you to invoke them with exactly the same number of parameters as they were declared with. Hence, when you invoke the jQuery constructor, you can pass different things to it. You can pass a string as an argument or another function, and the jQuery constructor will invoke different code based on the argument type. For example, if you pass it a string, jQuery will assume that it's a CSS selector, and the caller wants to find element(s) in the DOM that match this selector. Basically, you can think of it this way: whenever you want jQuery do something for you, invoke `$()` passing it your request.

You'll need to get used to yet another feature of jQuery: method chaining. Each function returns an object, and you don't have to declare a variable to hold this object. You can just write something like `funcA().funcB();`. This means that the method `funcB()` will be called on the object, returned by the `funcA()`.(((jQuery library, method chaining)))(((methods, chaining))) 

WARNING: Although method chaining is often presented as a great feature that allows you to do more with less typing, it can complicate the debugging of your code. Imagine that `funcA()` returns null for whatever reason. The entire chain (`funcB()` in our example) attached to `funcA()` won't work properly, and you might need to unchain these methods to find the problem.(((debugging, method chaining and)))

Also, if you need to access a DOM object more than once, save the reference in a variable and reuse it rather than invoking the same selector method in several chains. This can improve the performance of your web page. 

==== Hello World

The Hello World program is always a good start when learning any new software, and we'll go this route, too. <<ex_hello_world_jquery>> uses jQuery to display a web page that reads, "Hello World!" Note the functions that start with the `$` sign--they are all from the jQuery library.(((jQuery library, Hello World example))) 

[[ex_hello_world_jquery]]
.Hello World with jQuery
====
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
  	<meta charset="utf-8">
  	
  	<title>Hello jQuery</title>		
  </head>
  <body>
  	<script src="js/libs/jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>
  	<script>
  		$(function(){                                    // <1>
  			$("body").append("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");   // <2>
  			
  		});	
  	</script>
  </body>
</html>
----
====

<1> If the script passes a function as an argument to jQuery, this function is called when the DOM object is ready: the jQuery's `ready()` function is invoked. Keep in mind that it's not the same as invoking a function handler `window.onload`, which is called after all window resources (not just the DOM object) are completely  loaded (read more in <<handling_events>>). 

<2> If the script passes a string to jQuery, this string is treated as a CSS selector, and jQuery tries to find the matching collection of HTML elements (it will return the reference to just one `<body>` in the Hello World script). This line also demonstrates method chaining: the `append()` method is called on the object returned by `$("body")`. 

=== Using Selectors and Filters	

Probably the most frequently used routine in JavaScript code that's part of an HTML page is finding DOM elements and manipulating them, and this is where jQuery's power is. Finding HTML elements based on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Getting_started/Selectors[CSS selectors] is easy and concise. You can specify one or more selectors in the same query. <<ex_sample_jquery_selectors>> presents a snippet of code that contains random samples of selectors. Going through this code and reading the comments will help you understand how to use http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/[jQuery selectors]. (Note that with jQuery, you can write one selector for multiple IDs, which is not allowed in the pure JavaScript's `getElementById()`.)(((jQuery library, selectors/filters)))(((selectors)))(((filters)))

[[ex_sample_jquery_selectors]]
.Sample jQuery selectors
====
[source, javascript]
----

$(".donate-button"); // find the elements with the class donate-button

$("#login-link")  // find the elements with id=login-link

// find elements with id=map-container or id=video-container 
$("#map-container, #video-container"); 

// Find an HTML input element that has a value attribute of 200
$('input[value="200"]');

// Find all <p> elements that are nested somewhere inside <div> 
$('div p');

// Find all <p> elements that are direct children (located directly inside) <div>
$('div>p');

// Find all <label> elements that are styled with the class donation-heading
$('label.donation-heading');

// Find an HTML input element that has a value attribute of 200
// and change the text of its next sibling to "two hundred"
$('input[value="200"]').next().text("two hundred");
----
====

TIP: If jQuery returns a set of elements that match the selector's expression, you can access its elements by using array notation: `var theSecondDiv = $('div')[1]`. If you want to iterate through the entire set, use the jQuery method http://api.jquery.com/each/[`$(selector).each()`]. For example, if you want to perform a function on each paragraph of an HTML document, you can do so as follows: `$("p").each(function(){...})`. 

=== Testing jQuery Code with JSFiddle

The handy online site http://jsfiddle.net/[JSFiddle] can help you perform quick testing of code fragments of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other popular frameworks. This web page has a sidebar on the left and four large panels on the right. Three of these panels are for entering or copying and pasting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, respectively, and the fourth panel is for showing the results of applying this code (see <<FIG5-1>>).(((jQuery library, testing with JSFiddle)))(((JSFiddle)))((("test-driven development (TDD)", "JSFiddle")))

[[FIG5-1]]
.Testing jQuery by using JSFiddle 
image::images/ewdv_0301.png[float="true"]   

Copy and paste fragments from the HTML and CSS written for the Donate section of the Save The Child page into the top panels, and click the Run button on JSFiddle's toolbar. You'll see our donate form, where each radio button has a label in the form of digits (10, 20, 50, 100, 200). Now select jQuery 1.9.0 from the drop-down at the upper left and copy and paste the jQuery code fragment you'd like to test into the JavaScript panel located under the HTML one. As you see in <<FIG5-1>>, we've pasted `$('input[value="200"]').next().text("two hundred");`. After clicking the Run button, the jQuery script executes and the label of the last radio button changes from 200 to two hundred (test this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/yfain/R6DM2/[here]). JSFiddle's tutorial is located at http://doc.jsfiddle.net/tutorial.html[http://doc.jsfiddle.net/tutorial.html]. 


TIP: If you chained a method (for example, an event handler) to the HTML element returned by a selector, you can use `$(this)` from inside this handler to get a reference to this HTML element.

=== Filtering Elements

If the jQuery selector returns a number of HTML elements, you can further narrow this collection by applying filters. jQuery has such filters as `eq()`, `has()`, `first()`, and more.(((jQuery library, filtering elements)))(((elements, filtering)))

For example, applying the selector `$('label');` to the Donate section of the HTML fragment shown in <<FIG5-1>> would return a set of HTML elements called `<label>`. Say we want to change the background of the label 20 to be red. This is the third label in the HTML from <<FIG5-1>>, and the `eq(n)` filter selects the element at the zero-based index `n` within the matched set.

You can apply this filter by using the following syntax: `$('label:eq(2)');`. But jQuery documentation suggests using the syntax `$('label').eq(2);` http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/[for better performance].

Using method chaining, we'll apply the filter  `eq(2)` to the set of labels returned by the selector `$('label')` and then change the styling of the remaining HTML element(s) by using the `css()` method that can perform all CSS manipulations. This is how the entire expression will look:

[source, javascript]
----
$('label').eq(2).css('background-color', 'red'); 
----

Test this script in JSFiddle or in the code of one of the Save The Child projects from this chapter. The background of the label 20 will become red. If you wanted to change the CSS of the first label in this set, the filter expressions would look like `$('label:first')` or, for the better performance, you should do it like this:

[source, javascript]
----
$('label').filter(":first").css('background-color', 'red'); 
----

If you display data in an HTML table, you might want to change the background color of every even or odd row `<tr>`,  and jQuery offers you the filters `even()` and `odd()`. For example:

[source, javascript]
----
$('tr').filter(":even").css('background-color', 'grey');
----

Usually, you'd be doing this to interactively change the background colors. You can also alternate background colors by using the straight CSS selectors `p:nth-child(odd)` and `p:nth-child(even)`.

Check out jQuery API documentation for the complete list of http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/[selectors] and http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/filtering/[traversing filters]. 

TIP: If you need to display data in a grid-like form, consider using a JavaScript grid called https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid[SlickGrid].

[[handling_events]]
=== Handling Events

Adding events processing with jQuery is simple. Your code will follow the same pattern: find the element in DOM by using a selector or filter, and then attach the appropriate function that handles the event. We'll show you a handful of examples, but you can find a description of all methods that deal with events in the http://api.jquery.com/category/events/[jQuery API documentation].(((jQuery library, handling events))) 

There are a couple of ways of passing the handler function to be executed as a callback when a particular event is dispatched.  For example, our Hello World code passes a handler function to the `ready` event:

[source, javascript]
----
$(function());
----

This is the same as using the following syntax:

[source, javascript]
----
$(document).ready(function());
----

For the Hello World example, this was all that mattered; we just needed the DOM object to be able to append the `<h1>` element to it. But this would not be the right solution if the code needed to be executed only after all page resources have been loaded. In this case, the code could be written to utilize the DOM's `window.load` event, which in jQuery looks as follows:

[source, javascript]
----
$(window).load(function(){
		$("body").append("<h1>Hello World!</h1>"); 
});
----

If the user interacts with your web page by using a mouse, the event handlers can be added by using a similar procedure. For example, if you want the header in our Hello World example to process click events, find the reference to this header and attach the `click()` handler to it. Adding the following to the `<script>` section of Hello World will append the text each time the user clicks the header:

[source, javascript]
----
$("h1").click(function(event){
    $("body").append("Hey, you clicked on the header!");				
})
----

If you'd like to process double-clicks, replace the `click()` invocation with `dblclick()`. jQuery has handlers for about a dozen mouse events, which are wrapper methods to the corresponding JavaScript events that are dispatched when a mouse enters or leaves the area, the mouse pointer goes up/down, or the focus moves in or out of an input field. The shorthand methods `click()` and `dblclick()` (and several others) internally use the method `on()`, which you can and should use in your code, too (it works during the bubbling phase of the event, as described in the section "DOM Events" in the bonus online chapter).  

==== Attaching Event Handlers and Elements by Using the Method on()

Event methods can be attached just by passing a handler function, as in the preceding examples. You can also process the event by using the `on()` method, which allows you to specify the native event name and the event handler as its arguments. In <<programming_stc_with_jquery>>, you'll see lots of examples that use the `on()` method. The following one-liner assigns the function handler named `showLoginForm` to the `click` event of the element with the id `login-link`.(((event handlers/listeners)))(((elements, attaching event handlers to)))((("methods", "on()")))((("on()"))) <<handling-click-login-link>> includes the commented-out pure-JavaScript version of the code (see _project-02-login_ in <<mocking_up_the_app>>) that has the same functionality.

[[handling-click-login-link]]
.Handling the click on login link
====
[source, javascript]
----
    // var loginLink = document.getElementById("login-link");
    // loginLink.addEventListener('click', showLoginForm, false);
	
	$('#login-link').on('click', showLoginForm);
----
====

The `on()` method allows you to assign the same handler function to more than one event. For example, to invoke the `showLoginForm` function when the user clicks or moves the mouse over the HTML element, you could write `on('click mouseover', showLoginForm)`. 

The method `off()` is used for removing the event handler so that the event won't be processed anymore. For example, if you want to turn off the login link's ability to process the `click` event, simply write this:

[source, javascript]
----	 
	$('#login-link').off('click', showLoginForm);
----

==== Delegating Events

The method `on()` can be called by passing an optional selector as an argument. Because we haven't used selectors in this example, the event was triggered only when it reached the element with the ID `login-link`. Now imagine an HTML container that has child elements--for example, a calculator implemented as `<div id="calculator">` containing buttons.(((events, delegating))) The following code assigns a click handler _to each_ button styled with the class `.digitButton`:

[source, javascript]
----
$("div#calculator .digitButton").on("click", function(){...});
----

But instead of assigning an event handler to each button, you can assign an event handler to the container and specify an additional selector that can find child elements. The following code assigns the event handler function _to only one_ object—the `div#calculator` instructing this container to invoke the event handler when any of its children matching `.digitButton` is clicked:

[source, javascript]
----
$("div#calculator").on("click", ".digitButton",function(){...});
----

When the button is clicked, the event bubbles up and reaches the container's level, whose click handler will do the processing (jQuery doesn't support the capturing phase of events). The work on processing clicks for digit buttons is delegated to the container. 

Another good use case for delegating event processing to a container is a financial application that displays the data in an HTML table containing hundreds of rows. Instead of assigning hundreds of event handlers (one per table row), assign one to the table. There is one extra benefit to using delegation in this case: if the application can dynamically add new rows to this table (say, the order execution data), there is no need to explicitly assign event handlers to them; the container will do the processing for both old and new rows.

[NOTE]
====
Starting from jQuery 1.7, the method `on()` is a recommended replacement of the methods `bind()`, `unbind()`, `delegate()`, and `undelegate()` that are still being used in earlier versions of jQuery.  If you decide to develop your application with jQuery and its mobile version with jQuery Mobile, you need to be aware that the latter may not implement the latest code of the core jQuery.  Using `on()` is safe, though, because at the time of this writing jQuery Mobile 1.2 supports all the features of jQuery 1.8.2. <<responsive_design>> shows you how using responsive design principles can help you reuse the same code on both desktop and mobile devices.((("bind()")))((("unbind()")))((("delegate()")))
====

The method `on()` allows passing the data to the function handler (see the http://api.jquery.com/on/[jQuery documentation] for details). 

You are also allowed to assign different handlers to different events in one invocation of `on()`. The following code snippet from _project-11-jQuery-canvas-pie-chart-json_ assigns handlers to `focus` and `blur` events:

[source, javascript]
----
$('#customAmount').on({
	focus : onCustomAmountFocus,
	blur : onCustomAmountBlur
});
----

=== Using Ajax with jQuery

Making Ajax requests to the server is also easier with jQuery than with pure JavaScript. All the complexity of dealing with various flavors of `XMLHttpRequest` is hidden from the developers. The method http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/[`$.ajax()`] spares JavaScript developers from writing the code with multiple browser-specific ways of instantiating the `XMLHttpRequest` object. By invoking `ajax()`, you can exchange data with the server and load the JavaScript code. In its simplest form, this method takes just the URL of the remote resource to which the request is sent. This invocation uses global defaults that must be set in advance by invoking the method http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/[`ajaxSetup()`].(((jQuery library, using Ajax with)))((("Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)", " using jQuery with"))) 

But you can combine specifying parameters of the Ajax call and making the `ajax()` call. Just provide as an argument a configuration object that defines the URL, the function handlers for success and failures, and other parameters such as a function to call right before the Ajax request (`beforeSend`) or caching instructions for the browser (`cache`). 

Spend some time becoming familiar with all the configuration parameters that you can use with the jQuery method `ajax()`. Here's a sample template for calling jQuery `ajax()`:

[source, javascript]
----
$.ajax({ 
 		url: 'myData.json',
 		type: 'GET',
 		dataType: 'json'
	}).done(function (data) {...})
	  .fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus) {...});
----

This example takes a JavaScript object that defines three properties: the URL, the type of the request,  and the expected data type. Using chaining, you can attach the methods `done()` and `fail()`, which have to specify the function handlers to be invoked in case of success and failure, respectively. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR[jqXHR] is a jQuery wrapper for the browser's `XMLHttpRequest` object.(((jqXHR)))

Don't forget about the asynchronous nature of  Ajax calls, which means that the `ajax()` method  will be finished before the `done()` or `fail()` callbacks will be invoked. You can attach another _promised callback_ method called `always()` that will be invoked regardless of whether the `ajax()` call succeeds or fails.((("Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)", " asynchronous nature of")))(((promised callbacks)))(((callbacks, promised callbacks)))((("done()")))((("fail()"))) 

[NOTE]
====
An alternative to having a `fail()` handler for each Ajax request is setting the global error-handling routine by using `ajaxSetup()`.((("ajaxSetup()"))) Consider doing this for some serious HTTP failures such as 403 (access forbidden) or errors with codes 5__xx__. For example:

[source, javascript]
----
$(function() {
  $.ajaxSetup({
      error: function(jqXHR, exception) {
        if (jqXHR.status == 404) {
            alert('Requested resource not found. [404]');
        } else if (jqXHR.status == 500) {
            alert('Internal Server Error [500].');
        } else if (exception === 'parsererror') {
            alert('JSON parsing failed.');
        } else {
            alert('Got This Error:\n' + jqXHR.responseText);
        }
      }
  });
});
----
====

If you need to chain asynchronous callbacks (`done()`, `fail()`, `always()`) that don't need to be called right away (they wait for the result), the method `ajax()` returns the http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/[`Deferred`] object. It places these callbacks in a queue to be called later. As a matter of fact, the callback `fail()` might never be called if no errors occur.(((callbacks, chaining asynchronous))) 

If you specify JSON as a value of the `dataType` property, the result will be parsed automatically by jQuery; there is no need to call `JSON.parse()` as was done in <<using_ajax_and_json>>. Even though the jQuery object has a utility  method called `parseJSON()`, you don't have to invoke it to process a return of the `ajax()` call.

In the preceding example, the type of Ajax request was `GET`. But you can use `POST`, too. In this case, you need to prepare valid JSON data to be sent to the server, and the configuration object that you provide as an argument to the method `ajax()` has to include the property `data` containing valid JSON.

==== Handy Shorthand Methods

jQuery has several shorthand methods that allow making Ajax calls with a simpler syntax, which we'll consider next.(((jQuery library, shorthand methods for Ajax calls)))((("Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)", "jQuery shorthand methods")))

The method http://api.jquery.com/load/[`load()`] makes an Ajax call from an HTML element(s) to the specified URL (the first argument) and populates the HTML element with the returned data.((("load()"))) You can pass optional second and third arguments: HTTP request parameters and the callback function to process the results. If the second argument is an object, the `load()` method will make a `POST` request; otherwise, `GET`. You'll see the code that uses `load()` to populate states and countries from remote HTML files later in this chapter, in the section <<html_states_and_countries>>. But the next line shows an example of calling `load()` with two parameters, the URL and the callback:

[source, javascript]
----
 $('#counriesList').load('data/countries.html', function(response, status, xhr)
 {...});
----

The global method http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/[`get()`] allows you to specifically issue an HTTP `GET` request.((("get()"))) Similarly to the `ajax()` invocation, you can chain the `done(),` `fail()`, and `always()` methods to `get()`. For example: 

[source, javascript]
----
$.get('ssc/getDonors?city=Miami', function(){alert("Got the donors");})
  .done(function(){alert("I'm called after the donors retrieved");}
  .fail(function(){alert("Request for donors failed");});
;
----

The global method `post()` makes an HTTP `POST` request to the server. You must specify at least one argument--the URL on the server--and, optionally, the data to be passed, the callback to be invoked on the request completion, and the type of data expected from the server. Similarly to the `ajax()` invocation, you can chain the `done(),` `fail()`, and `always()` methods to `post()`. The following example makes a `POST` request to the server, passing an object with the new donor information:

[source, javascript]
----
$.post('ssc/addDonor', {id:123, name:"John Smith"});
;
----

The global method http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/[`getJSON()`] retrieves and parses the JSON data from the specified URL and passes the JavaScript object to the specified callback. If need be, you can send the data to the server with the request.((("getJSON()"))) Calling `getJSON()` is like calling `ajax()` with the parameter `dataType: "json"`, as shown in <<json-data-ajax-call>>.

[[json-data-ajax-call]]
.Getting JSON data using an Ajax call
====
[source, javascript]
----
$.getJSON('data/us-states-list.json', function (data) {
                // code to populate states combo goes here})
          .fail(function(){alert("Request for us states failed");});
----
====

The method http://api.jquery.com/serialize/[`serialize()`] is used when you need to submit to the server a filled-out HTML `<form>`. This method presents the form data as a text string in a standard URL-encoded notation. Typically, the code finds a required form by using a jQuery selector and then calls `serialize()` on this object. You can invoke `serialize()` not only on the entire form, but also on selected form elements.((("serialize()"))) The following is sample code that finds the form and serializes it:  

[source, javascript]
----
$('form').submit(function() {
  alert($(this).serialize());
  return false;
}); 
----
.Example 3.15 Serializing the form

TIP: Returning `false` from a jQuery event handler is the same as calling either `preventDefault()` or `stopPropagation()` on the `jQuery.Event` object. In pure JavaScript, returning `false` doesn't stop propagation (try to run http://jsfiddle.net/APQk6/[this fiddle]). 

Later in this chapter, in <<submitting_donate_form>>, you'll see code that uses the `serialize()` method.


[[programming_stc_with_jquery]]
=== Programming Save The Child by Using jQuery

In this section, we'll review code samples from several small projects (see <<appendix_c>> for running instructions) that are jQuery rewrites of the corresponding pure-JavaScript projects from <<mocking_up_the_app>> and <<using_ajax_and_json>>. We are not going to add any new functionality—the goal is to demonstrate how jQuery allows you to achieve the same results while writing less code. You'll also see how it can save you time by handling browser incompatibility for common uses (like Ajax).

==== Login and Donate

The file _main.js_ from _project-02-jQuery-Login_ is 33 percent smaller than _project-02-login_ written in pure JavaScript. jQuery allows your programs to be brief. For example, the following code shows how six lines of JavaScript can be replaced with one: the jQuery function `toggle()` toggles the visibility of `login-link`, `login-form`, and `login-submit`:(((jQuery library, application programming, login and donate)))(((donate section)))(((login section))) 

[NOTE]
====
The total size of your jQuery application is not necessarily smaller than the pure JavaScript one, because it includes the code of the jQuery library.
====

[source, javascript]
----
function showLoginForm() {

// The JavaScript way
// var loginLink = document.getElementById("login-link");
// var loginForm = document.getElementById("login-form");
// var loginSubmit = document.getElementById('login-submit');
// loginLink.style.display = "none";
// loginForm.style.display = "block";
// loginSubmit.style.display = "block";


// The jQuery way
$('#login-link, #login-form, #login-submit').toggle();
}
----

The code of the Donate section also becomes slimmer with jQuery. For example, the following section from the JavaScript version of the application is removed:

[source, javascript]
----
var donateBotton = document.getElementById('donate-button');
var donationAddress = document.getElementById('donation-address');
var donateFormContainer = document.getElementById('donate-form-container');
var customAmount = document.getElementById('customAmount');
var donateForm = document.forms['_xclick'];
var donateLaterLink = document.getElementById('donate-later-link');
----

The jQuery method chaining allows you to combine (in one line) finding DOM objects and acting upon them. <<ex_entire_jquery_script>> presents the entire code of _main.js_ from _project-01-jQuery-make-donation_, which includes the initial version of the code of the Login and Donate sections of Save The Child.(((methods, chaining)))(((jQuery library, method chaining)))

  	}
  }
  $('#otherAmount')
      .on({focus:onOtherAmountFocus, blur:onOtherAmountBlur});  // <3>

});
----
====

<1> This one-liner finds all elements of the form named `_xclick`, and immediately applies the jQuery filter to remove from this collection any elements except radio buttons. Then, it deselects all of them by setting the property `checked` to `false`.  This has to be done if the user places the focus inside the  Other Amount field.

<2> If the user leaves the Other Amount field, return the check to the previously selected radio button again. The `eq` filter picks the radio button whose number is equal to the value of the variable `checkedInd`.

<3> A single invocation of the `on()` method registers two event handlers: one for the `focus` and one for the `blur` event.

jQuery includes http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/[a number of effects] that make the user experience more engaging. Let's use one of them, called `fadeToggle()`. In the preceding code, a section that toggles visibility of the Donate form. If the user clicks the Donate Now button, the form becomes visible (see <<FIG3-11>>). If the user clicks the link "I'll donate later," the form becomes hidden, as in <<FIG3-10>>. The jQuery method `toggle()` does its job, but the change happens abruptly. The `fadeToggle()` effect allows us to introduce slower fading, which improves the user experience, at least to our taste.((("fadeToggle()")))((("toggle()"))) 

If you wanted to hide/show just one component, the code change would be trivial--replacing `toggle()` with `fadeToggle('slow')` would do the trick. But in our case, the toggle changes visibility of two ++<div>++s: `donation-address` and `donation-form-container`, which should happen in a certain order. The following code is a replacement of the show/hide section of _main.js_ to introduce the fading effect:

[source, javascript]
----
function showHideDonationForm(first, next) {
        first.fadeToggle('slow', function() {
                next.fadeToggle('slow');
        });
}

var donAddress = $('#donation-address');
var donForm = $('#donate-form-container');		

$('#donate-button').on('click', function() {
        showHideDonationForm(donAddress, donForm)});

$('#donate-later-link').on('click', function() {
        showHideDonationForm(donForm, donAddress)});	
----

If you want to see the difference, first run _project-01-jQuery-make-donation_ and click the Donate Now button (no effects), and then run _project-04-jQuery-donation-ajax-json_, which has the fading effect.

==== Loading HTML States and Countries by Using jQuery Ajax

==== Loading JSON States and Countries by Using jQuery Ajax

The project named _project-04-jQuery-donation-ajax-json_ demonstrates how to make a jQuery `ajax()` call to retrieve the JSON data about countries and states and populate the respective combo boxes in the donation form.  The function `loadData()` in <<ex_loading_using_ajax>> takes three arguments: the data URL, the name of the root element in the JSON file, and the target HTML element to be populated with the data retrieved from the Ajax call.

  }).done(function (data) {			                       // <2>
  	var optionsHTML = '';	
  	$.each(data[rootElement], function(index) {
  		optionsHTML+='<option value="'+data[rootElement][index].code+'">' +
  			               data[rootElement][index].name+'</option>'
  	});

  	var targetCurrentHTML = target.html();				  //  <3>

                         'usstateslist', $('#state'));   
loadData('data/counries-list.json',                            // <6>

<5> Calling `loadData()` to retrieve states and populate the `#state` combo box. The `usstatelist` is the name of the root element in the JSON file _us-states-list.json_.

<6> Calling `loadData()` to retrieve countries and populate the `#countriesList` combo box.

Compare this code with the pure JavaScript version from <<using_ajax_and_json>> that populates states and countries. If the jQuery code doesn't seem to be shorter, keep in mind that writing a cross-browser version in pure JavaScript would require more than a dozen additional lines of code that deal with the instantiation of `XMLHttpRequest`.

Run _project-04-jQuery-donation-ajax-json_. Open Google Developer Tools and click the Network tab. In <<FIG5-2>>, you can see that jQuery made two successful calls, retrieving two JSON files with the data on states and countries.

Now let's create an error situation to test the `$.ajax().fail()` chain. Just change the name of the first parameter to `data/counries.json` in the `loadData()` invocation. There is no such file, and the Ajax call will return the error 404. The watch expressions in <<FIG5-4>> depict the moment when the script execution stopped at the breakpoint in the `fail()` method.

===== Manual form serialization

If you simply want to submit this form to the URL listed in its `action` property when the user clicks the Submit button, there is nothing else to be done. This already works, and PayPal's login page opens in the browser. But if you want to seamlessly integrate your page with PayPal or any other third-party service, a preferred way is not to send the user to the third-party website but do it without leaving your web application. We won't be implementing such integration with PayPal here, but technically it would be possible to pass the user's credentials and bank information to charge the donor of Save The Child without even opening the PayPal web page in the browser. To do this, you'd need to submit the form by using Ajax, and the PayPal API would process the results of this transaction by using standard Ajax techniques.(((forms, manual serialization of)))    

To post the form to a specified URL by using jQuery Ajax, we'll serialize the data from the form on the `submit` event. The code fragment from _main.js_ finds the form with the ID `donate-form` and chains to it the `submit()` method, passing to it a callback that will prepare the data and make an Ajax call. You can use the method `submit()` instead of attaching an event handler to process clicks of the Donate Now button; the method `submit()` will be invoked not only on the Submit button click event, but when the user presses the Enter key while the cursor is in one of the form's input fields:

[source, javascript]
----
$('#donate-form').submit(function() {
  var formData = $(this).serialize();
  console.log("The Donation form is serialized:" + formData);
  // Make an AJAX call here and pass the data to the server
    
  return false;  // stop event propagation and default action
});
----

Run _project-04-jQuery-donation-ajax-json_ and open Chrome Developer Tools or Firebug. Then, fill out the donation form as shown in <<FIG5-5>>.

[[FIG5-5]]
.The Donation form
image::images/ewdv_0305.png[]

Now press the Enter key, and you'll see the output in the console with serialized form data that looks like this:

----
The Donation form is serialized: cmd=_xclick&business=email-registered-in-
paypal%40site-url.com&item_name=Donation&currency_code=USD&amount=50&amount=
&full_name=Alex+Smith&email_addr=asmith%40gmail.com&street_address=
123+Broadway&scty=New+York&zip=10013&state=NY&country=US
----

Manual form serialization has other advantages, too. For example, you don't have to pass the entire form to the server, but select only some of the input fields to be submitted. <<ex_sending_partial_form_content>> shows several ways of sending the partial form content.

<2> Find the form named '_xclick', apply the filter to select only the input fields of type `text`, and serialize them.

<3> Find the form named '_xclick', apply the filter to select only the hidden input fields, and serialize them.

We've prepared for you one more project illustrating manual serialization of the Donation form: _project-15-jQuery-serialize-form_. The _main.js_ file in this project suppresses the default processing of the form submit event and sends the form to a server-side PHP script. 

NOTE: We decided to show you a PHP example, because Java is not the only language for developing server-side code in enterprise applications. Running JavaScript on the server with Node.JS or using one of the JavaScript engines such as Google's V8 or Oracle's Nashorn can be considered too. 

For the purposes of our example, we will use a common technique of creating a server-side echo script that simply returns the data received from the server. Typically, in enterprise IT shops, server-side development is done by a separate team, and having a dummy server will allow frontend developers lower dependency on the readiness of the server with the real data feed. The file _demo.php_ is shown in <<ex_demo_server-side_script>>. It's located in the same directory as _index.html_.

The process of integration with the payment system using the https://www.x.com/content/introducing-adaptive-payments[PayPal API] is out of this book's scope, but at least we can identify the place to do it; it's typically done on the server side. In this chapter's example, it's a server-side PHP script, but it can be a Java, .NET, Python, or any other server. You need to replace the `echo` statement with the code making requests to PayPal or any other payment system. <<ex_submitting_dpnate_to_demo-php>> is the fragment from _main.js_ that shows how to make a request to _demo.php_.

  		onOffButton($('.donate-button-submit'), false, 'submitDisabled');
  	}).fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus, error) {   

        console.log('AJAX request failed: ' + error + ". Code: " 
                                            + jqXHR.status);

        // The code to display the error in the 
        // browser's window goes here                
        });
}

<1> Prevent the default processing of the submit event. We don't want to simply send the form to the URL listed in the form's `action` property.

<2>  Serialize the form fields, excluding the empty amounts and the hidden field with the name +cmd+.

<3>   The serialized data from `queryString` will be submitted to the server-side script _demo.php_.

.Installing the XAMPP Server with PHP Support
*****************************************************
The preceding example uses a server-side PHP script to echo data sent to it. If you'd like to see this script in action so you can test that the client and server can communicate, deploy this script in any web server that supports PHP. For example, you can install on your computer the XAMPP package from the http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html[ Apache Friends website], which includes Apache Web Server that supports PHP, FTP, and comes with a preconfigured MySQL database server (we are not going to use it). The installation process is simple: just go through the short instructions on the website that are applicable to your OS. Start the XAMPP Control application and click the Start button next to the label Apache. By default, Apache Web Server starts on port 80, so entering *http://localhost* opens the XAMPP welcome page.(((PHP, XAMPP server)))(((XAMPP server))) 

TIP: If you use Mac OS X, you might need to kill the preinstalled Apache server by using the +sudo apachectl stop+ command.

The directory _xampp/htdocs_ is the document root of the Apache Web Server, so you can place the _index.html_ of your project there or in one of its subdirectories. To test that a PHP is supported, save the following code in _helloworld.php_ in the _htdocs_ directory:

[source,php]
----
<?php
  echo('Hello World!');
?>
----

After entering the URL http://localhost/helloworld.php in your web browser, you should see a greeting from this simple PHP program. The home web page of the XAMPP server contains the link +phpinfo()+ on the left panel that shows the current configuration of your PHP server. 
*****************************************************

The easiest way to test _project-15-jQuery-serialize-form_ that uses _demo.php_ is to copy this folder into the _htdocs_ directory of your XAMPP installation. Then, enter the URL http://localhost/project-15-jquery-serialize-form/ in your web browser, and you'll see the Save The Child application. Fill out the form and click the Donate Now button. The form will be serialized and submitted to _demo.php_ as explained previously. If you open Google Developers Tools in the Network tab, you'll see that _demo.php_ has received the Ajax request and the console will show output similar to the following (for Alex Smith, alex@gmail.com):

[source, html]
----
-------- get the form inputs data  ----------- main.js:138
Submitting to the server: paypal_email=email-registered-in-paypal%40
site-url.com&item_name=Donation+to+the+Save+Sick+Child&currency_code
=USD&amount=50&full_name=Alex+Smith&email_addr=alex%40gmail.com main.js:139

-------- response from demo.php  ----------- main.js:146
Got the response from the ajax() call to demo.php: Got from the client 
and will send to PayPal: email-registered-in-paypal@site-url.com    
Payment type: Donation to the Save The Child   amount: 50 USD    
Thank you Alex Smith    
The confirmation will be sent to alex@gmail.com main.js:147

=== Using jQuery Plug-ins 

_jQuery plug-ins_ are reusable components that know how to do a certain thing--for example, validate a form or display images as a slide show.(((jQuery library, plug-ins for)))(((jQuery plug-ins))) Thousands of third-party jQuery plug-ins are available in the http://plugins.jquery.com/[jQuery Plugin Registry]. The following are some useful plug-ins:


http://www.jtable.org[jTable]::
    Ajax-based tables (grids) for CRUD applications
http://bit.ly/1nxfjds[jQuery Form]::
    An HTML form that supports Ajax
http://bit.ly/1m6y1pA[HorizontalNav]::
    A navigational bar with tabs that uses the full width of its container
http://bit.ly/1l4eHJA[EGrappler]::
    A stylish Akordeon (collapsible panel)
http://bit.ly/1jJNhce[Credit Card Validator]::
    Detects and validates credit card numbers
http://bit.ly/1pFbRRi[Responsive Carousel]::
    A slider to display images in a carousel fashion
http://bit.ly/1yGbPN1[morris.js]::
    A plug-in for charting
http://bit.ly/1pbqmi0[Map Marker]::
    Puts multiple markers on maps using Google Maps API V3
The http://bit.ly/1qFc88x[Lazy Load plug-in]::
    Delays loading of images, which are outside viewports

The chances are that you will be able to find a plug-in that fits your needs. jQuery plug-ins are usually freely available and their source code is plain JavaScript, so you can tweak it a little if need be.  

==== Validating the Donate Form by Using a Plug-in 

The _project-14-jQuery-validate_ project illustrates the use of the jQuery http://bit.ly/1q1UprG[Validator] plug-in, which allows you to specify the rules to be checked when the user tries to submit the form. If the value is not valid, your custom message is displayed.(((forms, validation with jQuery Validator plug-in)))(((jQuery Validator plug-in)))(((Validator plug-in)))(((jQuery library, application programming, form validation)))(((validation, of forms with jQuery Validator plug-in))) We've included this plug-in in _index.html_ of _project-14-jQuery-validate_:

[source, html]
----
<script src="js/plugins/jquery.validate.min.js"></script>
----

To validate a form with this plug-in, you need to invoke a jQuery selector that finds the form and then call the method `validate()` on this object; this is the simplest way of using this plug-in. But to have more control over the validation process, you need to pass the object with validation options:  

[source, javascript]
----
    $("#myform").validate({// validation options go here});
----

++++
<?hard-pagebreak?>
++++

The file _main.js_ includes the code to validate the Donation form. The validation routine can include many options, which are described in the plug-in documentation. Our code sample uses the following options:

* The `highlight` and `unhighlight` callbacks
* The HTML element to be used for displaying errors
* The name of the CSS class to style the error messages
* The validation rules

WARNING: Validating data only on the client side is not sufficient. It's a good idea to warn the user about data issues without sending the data to the server. But to ensure that the data was not corrupted/modified while traveling to the server, revalidate them on the server side too. Besides, a malicious user can access your server without using your web application. Performing server-side validation is a must.

<<ex_displaying_validation_errors>> displays error messages in the HTML element `<div id="validationSummary"></div>`  that's placed above the form in _index.html_. The Validator plug-in provides the number of invalid form entries by invoking `validator.numberOfInvalids()`, and our code displays this number unless it's equal to zero. 

[[ex_displaying_validation_errors]]
.Displaying validation errors
====
[source, javascript]
----
var validator = $('form[name="_xclick"]').validate({
	
  highlight : function(target, errorClass) {                    // <1>
  	$(target).addClass("invalidElement");
  	$("#validationSummary").text(validator.numberOfInvalids() +
  	                                       " field(s) are invalid");
  	$("#validationSummary").show();
  },

  unhighlight : function(target, errorClass) {                 // <2>
  	$(target).removeClass("invalidElement");

  	var errors = validator.numberOfInvalids();
  	$("#validationSummary").text( errors + " field(s) are invalid");

  	if(errors == 0) {
  		$("#validationSummary").hide();
  	}			
  },

  rules : {                                                   // <3>
  	full_name : {
  		required : true,
  		minlength : 2
  	},
  	email_addr : {
  		required : true,
  		email : true
  	},
  	zip : {
  		 digits:true
  	}
  },

  	messages : {                                            // <4>   
  		 full_name: {
              required: "Name is required",
            	minlength: "Name should have at least 2 letters"
          },
  		email_addr : {
  			required : "Email is required",
  		}
  	}
});
----
==== 

<1> When an invalid field is highlighted, this function is invoked. It changes the styling of the input field and updates the error count to display in the validation summary `<div>` on top  of the form.

<2> When the error is fixed, the highlighting on the corrected field is removed, and this function is invoked. It revokes the error styling of the input field and updates the error count. If the error count is zero, the validation summary `<div>` becomes hidden.

<3> Set the custom validation rules for selected form fields.

<4>	Set the custom error messages to be displayed if the user enters invalid data.

<<FIG5-7>> shows the preceding code in action. After entering a one-character name and an improper email address, the user will see the corresponding error messages. Each message is shown when the user leaves the corresponding field. But as soon as the user fixes any of them (for example, enters one more letter in the name), the form is immediately revalidated and the error messages are removed.

TIP: Before including a jQuery plug-in in your application, spend some time testing it. Check its size and compare its performance with competing plug-ins. 


==== Adding an Image Slider

Often, you need to add a feature to cycle through the images on a web page. The Save The Child page, for example, could display sequential images of the kids saved by the donors. To give you yet another demonstration of using a jQuery plug-in, we've created the project _project-16-jQuery-slider_ and integrated the jQuery plug-in called https://github.com/filamentgroup/responsive-carousel[Responsive Carousel].(((jQuery library, application programming, image slider)))(((images, web page image slider)))(((Responsive Carousel plug-in)))  The file _index.html_ of this project includes the CSS styles and the JavaScript code plug-in, as follows:

[source, html]
----
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/responsive-carousel.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/responsive-carousel.slide.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/responsive-carousel.fade.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/responsive-carousel.flip.css" />
...
<script src="js/plugins/responsive-carousel/responsive-carousel.min.js">
</script>
<script src="js/plugins/responsive-carousel/responsive-carousel.flip.js">
</script>
----

Run _project-16-jQuery-slider_, and you'll see how three plain slides display in succession, as shown in <<FIG5-8>>. The HTML part of the container includes the three slides as follows: 

[source, html]
----
<div id="image-carousel" class="carousel carousel-flip" 
                                         data-transition="flip">
	<div>
		<img src="assets/img/slides/slide-1.jpg" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<img src="assets/img/slides/slide-2.jpg" />
	</div>
	<div>
		<img src="assets/img/slides/slide-3.jpg" />
	</div>
</div>
----

[[FIG5-8]]
.Using the Responsive Carousel plug-in
image::images/ewdv_0307.png[]

With this plug-in, the JavaScript code that the application developer has to write to implement several types of rotation is minimal. When the user clicks one of the radio buttons (Fade, Slide, or Flip Transitions) the following code just changes the CSS class name to be used with the carousel:

[source, javascript]
----
$(function() {
	$("input:radio[name=transitions]").click(function() {
		var transition = $(this).val();
		var newClassName = 'carousel carousel-' + transition;
		$('#image-carousel').attr('class', '');
		$('#image-carousel').addClass(newClassName);
		$('#image-carousel').attr('data-transition', transition);
	});
});
----


TIP: To see code samples of using the Responsive Carousel plugin (including popular autoplaying slide shows), check out the http://bit.ly/1prR6tB[Responsive Carousel variations].

The Validator and Responsive Carousel plugins clearly demonstrate that jQuery plugins can save you some serious time writing code to implement commonly required features. It's great that the members of the jQuery community from around the world share their creations with other developers. If you can't find a plug-in that fits your needs or have specific custom logic that needs to be used or reused in your application, you can write your own plugin. Should you decide to write a plug-in of your own, refer to the http://bit.ly/1hQJcYr[Plugins/Authoring] document.


=== Summary

In this chapter, you became familiar with the jQuery Core library, which is the de facto standard library in millions of web applications. Its simplicity and extensibility via the mechanism of plug-ins make it a must-have in almost every web page. Even if your organization decides on a more complex and feature-rich JavaScript framework, the chances are that you might find a handy jQuery plug-in that will complement "the main" framework and make it into the code of your application. There is nothing wrong with this, and you shouldn't be in the position of "either jQuery or XYZ"—most likely they can coexist. 

We can recommend one of the small frameworks that  will complement your jQuery code: http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/[Twitter's Bootstrap]. Bootstrap can quickly make the UI of your desktop or mobile application look stylish. Bootstrap is https://github.com/popular/starred[the most popular framework] on GitHub.(((Twitter's Bootstrap)))(((Bootstrap)))

<<tdd_with_javascript>> shows you how to test jQuery applications. In this chapter,  we rewrote a pure JavaScript application for illustration purposes. But if this were a real-world project to convert the Save The Child application from JavaScript to jQuery, having tests even for the JavaScript version of the application would have helped to verify that everything transitioned to jQuery successfully.

In <<jquery_mobile>> you'll learn how to use the jQuery Mobile library--an API on top of jQuery code that allows building UIs for mobile devices.

Now that we've covered JavaScript, HTML5 APIs, Ajax, JSON, and the jQuery library, we're going to the meat of the book: frameworks, productivity tools,  and strategies for making your application enterprise-ready.
