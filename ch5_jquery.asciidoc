== Save Sick Child with JQuery 

Up till now we've been using HTML, JavaScript and CSS to create the Save Sick Child Web application.  In the real world, developers try to be more productive by using JavaScript libraries and MVC frameworks. Libraries do not dictate how to structure the code of your application - they offer you components that allow to write less code. MVC frameworks force you to organize your code in layers implementing the Model-View-Controller design pattern.  There are more than a dozen MVC JavaScript frameworks that are being used by professional developers: http://backbonejs.org/[Backbone.js], http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs[ExtJS], AngularJS, http://emberjs.com/[Ember.js], http://knockoutjs.com/[Knockout] just to name a few. In this chapter we'll introduce the JavaScript library called jQuery. Chapter 6 is about the JavaScript framework ExtJS. Their mobile counterparts are called jQuery Mobile and Sencha Touch (see Chapter 12 and 13). 

http://jquery.com/[jQuery] is the most popular JavaScript library. More than 60% of top Web sites use jQuery (visit http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/top[http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/top] for the current statistics). jQuery is simple to use and doesn't require you to dramatically change the way you program for the Web. jQuery offers you a helping hand with the tasks that most of the Web developers need to deal with, for example, finding and manipulating DOM elements, processing browser's events, and dealing with browser incompatibility. Since jQuery is an extensible framework, lots and lots of plugins were created by developers from around the world, and all of them are available for free. If you can't find the plugin that fits your need - create one yourself.

Besides jQuery and jQuery Mobile there is a http://jqueryui.com/[jQuery UI library], which is a set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery. You can find in jQuery UI such widgets as Datepicker, Accordion, Slider, Tabs, Autocomplete and more. jQuery UI will also help you with adding to your Web page various interactions (e.g. drag and drop)  and effects (e.g. adding CSS classes or animations). jQuery UI is built on top of jQuery core library and can't be used independently. 

In this chapter we'll briefly cover the basics of jQuery. Our goal is not to provide you with a detailed jQuery primer - there are jQuery books and http://api.jquery.com/[the online API Documentation] that provide a comprehensive explanation of jQuery. But we'll give you just enough of the information to  understand how jQuery can be used. In the section Working on Save Sick Child we'll review the code of several versions of this application highlighting the benefits of using JQuery library.  

=== jQuery Intro


At the time of this writing the current version of jQuery is 1.9. You can download one of two distributions of jQuery framework. The gzipped minified version of jQuery weighs 33Kb (it's 93Kb if unzipped), and this is all you need unless you are planning to develop jQuery plugins, in which case get a larger development version - it's about 270Kb. We've downloaded it from jquery.com and included it in the `<script>` tag in our HTML code samples so you can run them even if the Internet connection is not available. 

But instead of deploying jQuery framework on your servers as a part of your application, you should use a common Content Delivery Network (CDN) URL in your HTML as shown below. Since jQuery is an extremely popular library, many Web sites use it. If more than one Web page would get it from the same CDN, the Web browser would cache it locally and reuse it rather than downloading a separate copy from different servers for every Web application that uses jQuery. The http://jquery.com/download/[download page of jquery.com] offers three CDN: Google, Microsoft, and MediaTemple. For example, if you don't need to use HTTPS protocol with your application the MediaTemple's CDN suffice:

[source, html]
----
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script>
----

After covering JQuery basics, we are going to continue reviewing the code of a series of Aptana projects representing same old Save Sick Child application, but this  using jQuery. We won't add any new functionality to this application - we want to show that the developers can be more productive in achieving the same result.

Some people will say that anyone who knows HTML can learn jQuery, but this is not so. Understanding of JavaScript is required. If you've read and understood the content from Chapter 2 - you're ready to learn jQuery.  The jQuery programming starts with with invoking the jQuery constructor named `jQuery()`. But people are using the shorter version of this constructor that's represented by a $ sign: `$()`. This `$` property is the only object that jQuery will create in the global namespace. Everything else will be encapsulated inside the `$` object.  

As you remember, JavaScript functions do not require you to invoke them with exactly the same number of parameters as they were declared with. Hence, when you invoke jQuery constructor you can pass different things to it. You can pass a String as an argument or another function, and jQuery constructor will invoke different code based on the argument type. For example, if you'll pass it a String, jQuery will assume that it's a CSS selector, and the caller wants to find element(s) in the DOM that match this selector. Basically, you may think of it this way - whenever you want jQuery do something for you, invoke `$()` passing it your request.

You'll need to get used to yet another feature of jQuery - method chaining. Each function returns an object, and you don't have to declare a variable to hold this object. You can just write something like `funcA().funcB();` This means that the method `funcB()` will be called on the object, returned by the `funcA()`. 

==== Hello World


Let's start using jQuery rather then talking about it. The "Hello World" program is always a good start. 

[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		
		<title>Hello jQuery</title>		
	</head>
	<body>
		<script src="js/libs/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"></script>
		<script>
			$(function(){                                      // <1>
				$("body").append("<h1>Hello World!</h1>");     // <2>
				
			});	
		</script>
	</body>
</html>


----

<1> If the script passes a function to jQuery, it's getting invoked when the DOM object is ready - the jQuery's `ready()` function gets invoked . Keep in mind that it's not the same as invoking a function handler `window.onload`, which is called after all windows resources (not just the DOM object) are completely  loaded (read more in the jQuery Events section). 

<2> If the script passes a String to jQuery, such Strolling is being treated as a CSS selector, and jQuery tries to find the matching collection of HTML elements (it'll return the reference to just one `<body>` in the Hello World script). This line also demonstrates the method chaining - the `append()` method is called on the object returned by `$("body")`. 

=== Selectors and Filters	

Finding HTML elements based on the CSS selectors is very easy and you can specify one or more selectors in the same query. For example:

[source, javascript]
----

$(".donate-button"); // find the elements with the class donate-button

$("#login-link")  // find the elements with id=login-link

// find elements with id=map-container and id=video-container 
$("#map-container #video-container"); 

// Find an HTML input element that has a value attribute of 200
$('input[value="200"]');

// Find an HTML input element that has a value attribute of 200
// and change the text of its next sibling to "two hundred"
"$('input[value="200"]').next().text("two hundred");

----

There is a handy online site http://jsfiddle.net/[JSFiddle] for performing quick testing of code fragments of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks. This Web page has a sidebar of the left and four large panels on the right. Three of these panels are for entering or copy/pasting: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the forth panel is for showing the results of applying this code (see <<FIG5-1>>).

[[FIG5-1]]
.Testing jQuery using JSFiddle 
image::images/fig_05_1.png[]   

Copy/paste the fragments from the HTML and CSS written for the Donate section of the Save Sick Child page into the top panels, and press the button Run on JSFiddle's toolbar, you'll see our donate form where each radiobutton has a label in the form of digits (10, 20, 50, 100, 200). Now select jQuery 1.9.0 from the dropdown at the top left and copy paste the jQuery code fragment you'd like to test into the JavaScript panel locate under the HTML one. As you see on <<FIG5-1>>, we've pasted `$('input[value="200"]').next().text("two hundred");`. After pressing the button Run the jQuery script was executed and the label of the last radiobutton has been replaced from "200" to "two hundred". JSFiddle's tutorial is located at http://doc.jsfiddle.net/tutorial.html[http://doc.jsfiddle.net/tutorial.html]. 


TIP: If you chained a method, e.g. an event handler, to the HTML element returned by a selector, your can use `$(this)` from inside such a handler to get a reference to this HTML element.

If jQuery selector returns a number of HTML elements, you can further narrow down this collection by applying so-called filters.jQuery has such filters as `eq()`, `has()`, `first()` and more.

For example, applying the selector `$('label');`to the Donate section HTML fragment shown in <<FIG5-1>> would return a set of HTML elements `<label>`. Say we want to change the background of the label "20" to be red. This is the third label in the HTML from <<FIG5-1>>, and the `eq(n)` filter selects the element at the zero-based index `n` within the matched set.

You can apply this filter using the following syntax: `$('label:eq(2)');`. But jQuery documentation suggest to use the syntax `$('label').eq(2);` http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/[for better performance].

Using method chaining we'll apply the filter  `eq(2)` to the set of lables returned by the selector `$('label')` and then and then change the styling of the remaining HTML element(s) using the `css()` method that can do all CSS manipulations. This is how the entire expression will look like:

[source, javascript]
----
$('label').eq(2).css('background-color', 'red'); 
----

Test this script in HSFiddle or in the code of one of the Save Sick Child projects from this chapter. The background of the label "20" will be red. If you wanted to change the CSS of the first label in this set, the filter expressions could look as `$('label:first')` or, for the better performance, you should do it like this:

[source, javascript]
----
$('label').filter(":first").css('background-color', 'red'); 
----

If you display data in HTML table, you may want to change the background color of every even or odd row `<tr>`,  and jQuery offers you the filters `even()` and `odd()`, for example:

[source, javascript]
----
$('tr').filter(":even").css('background-color', 'grey');
----

TODO: each()


=== Events

Adding events processing with jQuery is simple, and your code will be following the same pattern: find the element in DOM using selector or filter, and then attach the appropriate function that handles the required event. We'll show you a handful of code sample of how to do it, but you can find the description of all methods that deal with events in the http://api.jquery.com/category/events/[jQuery API documentation]. 

Our Hello World example used a short version of passing the handler function to the `ready()` function:
`$(function());`

This is the same as using the following syntax:

`$(document).ready(function());`

For the Hello World example this was all that mattered - we just needed to have the DOM object to be able to append the `<h1>` element to it. But this would not be the right solution if the code needs to be executed only after all page resources have been loaded. In such case the code could have been re-written to utilize the DOM's `window.load` event, which in jQuery looks as follows:

[source, javascript]
----
$(window).load(function(){
		$("body").append("<h1>Hello World!</h1>"); 
});
----

If the user interacts with your Web page using the mouse , the events handlers can be added using a similar procedure. For example, if you want the header in our Hello World example to process click events, find the reference to this header and attach the `click()` handler to it. Adding the following to the `<script>` section of Hello World will append the text each time the user clicks on the header.

[source, javascript]
----
$("h1").click(function(event){
    $("body").append("Hey, you clicked on the header!");				
})
----

If you'd like to process double-clicks - replace the `click()` invocation with `dblclick()`. jQuery has handlers for about a dozen mouse events, which are wrapper methods to the corresponding JavaScript events that are dispatched when mouse entering or leaving the area, the mouse pointer goes up/down, or the focus moves in or out of an input field. The shorthand methods `click()` and `dblclick()` (and several others) internally use the method `on()`, which you can and should use in your code too.  

==== Binding Events With The Method on()

The event methods can be attached just by passing a handler function as it was done in the above examples, or to process the event or by using the `on()` method, which allows you to specify the native event name and the event handler as its arguments. In the section Working on Save Sick Child you'll see lots of examples, where the `on()` method is used. The one liner below assigns the function handler named `showLoginForm` to the `click` event of the element with the id `login-link`. The following code snippets includes the commented out pure-JavaScript version of the code (see project-02-login in Chapter 3) that has the same functionality:

[source, javascript]
----
    // var loginLink = document.getElementById("login-link");
    // loginLink.addEventListener('click', showLoginForm, false);
	
	$('#login-link').on('click', showLoginForm);
----


The `on()` method allows you to assign the same handler function to more than one event. For example, to invoke the `showLoginForm` function when the user clicks or moves the mouse over the HTML element you could written  `on('click mouseover', showLoginForm)`. 

The method `off()` is used for removing the event handler and the event won't be processed anymore. For example, if you want to turn off the login link's ability to process `click` event, simply write this:

[source, javascript]
----	
	$('#login-link').off('click', showLoginForm);
----

==== Delegated Events

The method `on()` can be called with passing an optional selector as an argument. Since we haven't used it in the example from the previous section, the event was triggered only when reached the element with an id `login-link`. Now imagine an HTML container that has child elements, e.g. a calculator implemented as a `<div id="calculator">` containing buttons. The following code would assign a click handler *to each* button stlyled with a class `.digitButton`:

[source, javascript]
----
$("div#calculator .digitButton").on("click", function(){...});
----

But instead of assigning an event handler to each button, you can assign an event handler to the container and specify additional selector that child elements may be found by. The following code assigns the event handler function *to only one* object - the `div#calculator` instructing this container to invoke the event handler when any of its children matching `.digitButton` is clicked. 

[source, javascript]
----
$("div#calculator").on("click", ".digitButton",function(){...});
----

When the button is clicked, the event bubbles up and reaches the container's level, whose click handler will do the processing. The work on processing clicks for digit buttons is delegated to the container. 

Another good use case for delegating event processing to a container is a financial application that displays the data in an HTML table containing hundreds of rows. Instead of assigning event hundreds event handlers (one per table row), assign one to the table. There is one extra benefit to using delegation in this case - if the application can dynamically add new rows to this table (say, the order execution data), there is no need to explicitly assign event handlers to them - the container will do the processing for both old and new rows.

****

NOTE: Starting from jQuery 1.7, the method `on()` is a recommended replacement of the methods `bind()`, `unbind()`, `delegate()`, and `undelegate()` that are still being used in earlier versions of jQuery.  If you decide to develop your application with jQuery and its mobile version with jQuery Mobile, you need to be aware that the latter may not implement the latest code of the core jQuery.  Using `on()` is safe though, because at the time of this writing jQuery Mobile 1.2 supports all the features of jQuery 1.8.2. In Chapter 11, you'll see how using the responsive design principles can help you to reuse the same code on both desktop and mobile devices.

****

The method `on()` allows passing the data to the function handler. 

You are also allowed to assign different handlers to different events in on invocation of `on()`. The following code snippet from project-11-jQuery-canvas-pie-chart-json assigns handlers to `focus` and `blur` events:

[source, javascript]
----
$('#customAmount').on({
	focus : onCustomAmountFocus,
	blur : onCustomAmountBlur
});
----


TODO: custom events


=== AJAX with jQuery

Making AJAX requests to the server is also easier with jQuery than with pure JavaScript. All the complexity of `$.ajax()` method is hidden from the developers. By invoking `ajax()` you can exchange the data with the server and load the JavaScript code. In its simplest form, this method takes just the URL of the remote resource to which the request is sent. Such invocation will use defaults that should be set in advance by invoking the method `ajaxSetup()`. 

But you can combine specifying parameters of the AJAX call and making the `ajax()` call. Just provide as an argument a configuration object that defines the URL, the function handlers for success and failures, and some other parameters like a function to call right before the AJAX request (`beforeSend`) or caching instructions for the browser (`cache`). The template for calling jQuery `ajax()` may look as shown below.

[source, javascript]
----
$.ajax({ 
 		url: 'myData.json',
 		type: 'GET',
 		dataType: 'json'
	}).done(function (data) {...})
	  .fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus) {...
	});
----

This example takes a JavaScript object that defines three properties: the URL, the type of the request,  and the expected data type. Using chaining, you can attach the methods `done()` and `fail()`, which have to specify the function handlers to be invoked in case of success and failure. You may attach yet another _promised callback_ methods like `always()` and `then()`. Remember the asynchronous nature of the AJAX calls, which means that the `ajax()` method  will be finished before the `done()` or `fail()` callbacks will be invoked.  

If you'll specify JSON as a value of the `dataType` property, the result will be parsed automatically by jQuery - there is no need to call `JSON.parse()` as it was done in Chapter 4. jQuery object has a utility  method `parseJSON()`, but you don't have to invoke it to process return of the `ajax()` call.

In the above example the type of the AJAX request was `GET`. But you can use `POST` too. In this case you'll need to prepare valid JSON data to be sent to the server. In this case the configuration object that you provide as an argument to the method `ajax()` has to include the property `data` containing valid JSON.


=== Working on Save Sick Child 

In this section we'll review code samples from several Aptana projects that are jQuery re-writes of the corresponding pure-JavaScript projects from Chapter 3. We are not going to add any new functionality - the goal is to demonstrate that jQuery allows you to achieve the same results with writing less code. 

==== Login and Donate

For example, the file main.js from project-02-jQuery-Login is 33% less in size than project-02-login. jQuery is brief. For example, the next code shows how six lines of code in JavaScript can be replaced with one - the jQuery function `toggle()` will toggle the visibility of `login-link`, `login-form`, and `login-submit`.

[source, javascript]
----
function showLoginForm() {

// The JavaScript way
// var loginLink = document.getElementById("login-link");
// var loginForm = document.getElementById("login-form");
// var loginSubmit = document.getElementById('login-submit');
// loginLink.style.display = "none";
// loginForm.style.display = "block";
// loginSubmit.style.display = "block";


// The jQuery way
$('#login-link, #login-form, #login-submit').toggle();
}
----

The code of the Donation section also becomes slimmer with jQuery. For example, the following section from the JavaScript version of the application is removed:

[source, javascript]
----
var donateBotton = document.getElementById('donate-button');
var donationAddress = document.getElementById('donation-address');
var donateFormContainer = document.getElementById('donate-form-container');
var customAmount = document.getElementById('customAmount');
var donateForm = document.forms['_xclick'];
var donateLaterLink = document.getElementById('donate-later-link');
----

The jQuery method chaining allows combining (in one line) finding DOM objects and acting upon them. The following is the entire code of the main.js from project-02-01-jQuery-make-donation, which includes the initial version of the code of Login and Donate sections of Save Sick Child.

[source, javascript]
----
/* --------- login section -------------- */

$(function() {

  function showLoginForm() {
  	$('#login-link, #login-form, #login-submit').toggle();
  }

  $('#login-link').on('click', showLoginForm);

  function showAuthorizedSection() {
  	$('#authorized, #login-form, #login-submit').toggle();
  }

  function logIn() {
  	var userNameValue = $('#username').val();
  	var userNameValueLength = userNameValue.length;
  	var userPasswordValue = $('#password').val();
  	var userPasswordLength = userPasswordValue.length;

  	//check credentials
  	if (userNameValueLength == 0 || userPasswordLength == 0) {
  		if (userNameValueLength == 0) {
  			console.log('username is empty');
  		}
  		if (userPasswordLength == 0) {
  			console.log('password is empty');
  		}
  	} else if (userNameValue != 'admin' || userPasswordValue != '1234') {
  		console.log('username or password is invalid');
  	} else if (userNameValue == 'admin' && userPasswordValue == '1234') {
  		showAuthorizedSection();
  	}
  }

  $('#login-submit').on('click', logIn);

  function logOut() {
  	$('#username, #password').val('')
  	$('#authorized, #login-link').toggle();
  }

  $('#logout-link').on('click', logOut);

  $('#profile-link').on('click', function() {
  	console.log('Profile link was clicked');
  });
});

/* --------- make donation module start -------------- */
$(function() {		
  var checkedInd = 2;  // initially checked radiobutton
  		
  
  // Show/hide the donation form if the user clicks
  // on the button Donate or the Donate Later
  function showHideDonationForm() {
  	$('#donation-address, #donate-form-container').toggle();
  }
  $('#donate-button').on('click', showHideDonationForm);
  $('#donate-later-link').on('click', showHideDonationForm);
  // End of show/hide section

  $('#donate-form-container').on('click', resetOtherAmount);
  
  function resetOtherAmount(event) {
  	if (event.target.type == "radio") {
  		$('#otherAmount').val('');
  	}
  }

  //uncheck selected radio buttons if other amount was chosen	
  function onOtherAmountFocus() {
  	var radioButtons = $('form[name="_xclick"] input:radio');
  	if ($('#otherAmount').val() == '') {
  		checkedInd = radioButtons.index(radioButtons.filter(':checked'));
  	}
  	$('form[name="_xclick"] input:radio').prop('checked', false);  // <1>
  }
  
  function onOtherAmountBlur() {
  	if ($('#otherAmount').val() == '') {
  		$('form[name="_xclick"] input:radio:eq(' + checkedInd + ')')
  		                     .prop("checked", true);   	 // <2>
  	}
  }
  $('#otherAmount')
      .on({focus:onOtherAmountFocus, blur:onOtherAmountBlur});  // <3>

});
----

<1> This one liner finds all elements of the form named `_xclick`, and immediately applies the jQuery filter to remove from this collection any elements except radiobuttons. Then it unchecks all of them by setting the property `checked` to `false`.  This has to be done if the user places the focus inside the  "Other amount" field.

<2> If the user leaves the "Other amount" return the check the previously selected radiobutton again. The `eq` filter picks the radiobutton whose number is equal to the value of the variable `checkedInd`.  

<3> A single invocation of the `on()` method registers two event handlers: one for the `focus` and one for the `blur` event.

jQuery includes http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/[a number of effects] that make the user experience more engaging. Let's use one of them called `fadeToggle()`. In the code above there is a section that toggles visibility of the Donate form. If the user clicks on the Donate button, the form becomes visible (see <<FIG3-11>>). If the user clicks on the link "I'll donate later", the form becomes hidden as in <<FIG3-10>>. The jQuery method `toggle()` does its job, but the change happens abruptly. The effect `fadeToggle()` allows to introduce slower fading which improves the user experience, at least to our taste. 

If the code would hide/show just one component, the code change would be trivial - replacing `toggle()` with `fadeToggle('slow')` would do the trick.  But in our case, the toggle changes visibility of two `<div>'s`: `donation-address` and `donation-form-container`, which should happen in a certain order. The code below is a replacement of the show/hide section in the main.js to introduce the fading effect.

[source, javascript]
----
function showHideDonationForm(first, next) {
        first.fadeToggle('slow', function() {
                next.fadeToggle('slow');
        });
}

var donAddress = $('#donation-address');
var donForm = $('#donate-form-container');		

$('#donate-button').on('click', function() {
        showHideDonationForm(donAddress, donForm)});

$('#donate-later-link').on('click', function() {
        showHideDonationForm(donForm, donAddress)});	
----

If you want to see the difference, first run the Aptana's project-02-01-jQuery-make-donation and click on the Donate button (no effects), and then run project-04-jQuery-donation-ajax-json, which has the fading effect.


==== States and Countries with AJAX

The Aptana project named project-04-jQuery-donation-ajax-json demonstrates how to premaking the AJAX call to retrieve the JSON data about countries and states, which are required to populate the respective comboboxes in the donation form.

[source, javascript]
----
function loadData(dataUrl, rootElement, target) {
  $.ajax({ 
  	url: dataUrl,
  	type: 'GET',
  	cache: false,
  	dataType: 'json'
  }).done(function (data) {			
  	var optionsHTML = '';	
  	$.each(data[rootElement], function(index) {
  		optionsHTML+='<option value="'+data[rootElement][index].code+'">' +
  			               data[rootElement][index].name+'</option>'
  	});

  	var targetCurrentHTML = target.html();						
  	var targetNewHTML = targetCurrentHTML + optionsHTML;
  	target.html(targetNewHTML);   		
  }).fail(function (jqXHR, textStatus) {
  	console.log('Error status code:' + jqXHR.status);
  	if (textStatus === 'parsererror') {
           console.log('Requested JSON parse was failed.');
       } else if (textStatus === 'abort') {
           console.log('Ajax request was aborted.');
       }
  });
}

// Load the State and Country comboboxes
loadData('data/us-states-list.json', 'usstateslist', $('#state'));
loadData('data/counries-list.json', 'countrieslist', $('#counriesList'));
----
