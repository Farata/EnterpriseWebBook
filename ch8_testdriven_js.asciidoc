== Test-Driven Development with JavaScript

// [quote, @bphogan, http://twitter.com/bphogan/status/194856922208407552]

To shorten the development cycle of your Web application you need to start testing it on the early stages of the project. It seems obvious, but many enterprise IT organizations haven't adopted the agile testing methodologies, which costs them dearly. JavaScript is dynamically typed interpreted language, which means that there is no compiler to help to identifying errors as it's done in compiled languages like Java. This means that a lot more time should be allocated for testing for JavaScript Web applications. Moreover, a programmer who didn't introduce unit testing techniques into his daily routine can't be 100% sure that his code is working properly.

The static code analysis and code quality tools such as http://esprima.org/[Esprima] and http://www.jshint.com/[JSHint] will help in reducing the number of syntax errors and improve the quality of your code. Later in this chapter we will demonstrate how to setup +JSHint+ for your JavaScript project and check your code for the syntax errors automatically. 

To switch to a test-driven development mode, make testing a part of your development process in its early stages rather than scheduling testing after the development cycle is complete.

Introduction of test-driven development may substantially improve you code quality. It is very important to receive the feedback about your code on a regular basis. That's why unit tests must be automated. Ideally, the tests should run as soon as you've changed the code. In this chapter we are going to introduce Grunt - the task runner tool - that can help you with automation of repetitive operations like running unit tests when the code changes. 

There are many testing frameworks in JavaScript world, and in this chapter we'll give you a brief overview of two of them: http://qunitjs.com/[Qunit] and http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/[Jasmine]. The main goal of each framework to is to test small pieces of code a.k.a. _units_.  We will also show how to abstract your JavaScript project lifecycle from any specific frameworks or libraries using Grunt tool.

We will go through the basic testing techniques such as "Test-driver development" and "Test First". You'll learn how to automate the testing process in multiple browsers with http://vojtajina.github.com/testacular/[Testacular] or by running tests in so called _headless_ mode with http://phantomjs.org/[PhantomJS]. You'll learn how to mock and stub selected artifacts of the environment (such as `XMLHTTPRequiest` object or timer) with http://sinonjs.org/[Sinon.js] and how to unit test the DOM manipulation code.

The second part of this chapter is dedicated to setting up a new Save Sick Child project in the IDE with selected test frameworks.

=== Why Testing

Any software has bugs. But in interpreted languages like JavaScript you don't have help of compilers that could have pointed you at the potential issues on early stages of development. You need to continue testing the code over and over again to catch regression errors, to be able to add new features without breaking the existing ones. The code covered with tests is easy to refactor. Tests help to prove correctness of your code. A well tested code leads to the better overall design of your programs.

=== Testing Basics

In this chapter we are going to discuss the following types of testing (we don't cover QA and UAT in this book):

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Functional tests
- Load (a.k.a. stress) tests

Let's go over the strategies, approaches, and tools that will help you in automation of each of the above tests.

==== Unit Testing

The _unit test_ is a piece of code that invokes the method or class being tested. It _asserts_ some assumptions about the application logic and behavior of the  method or class. You'll be writing unit tests using a unit-testing framework. The test should run fast, be automated and readable. For example you can test that if a function is called with a particular arguments, it should return an expected result.
We will take a closer look on unit testing terminology and vocabulary in a <<TDD>> section.


==== Integration Testing

Integration testing is a phase when already tested units are combined into a module to test the interfaces between them. You may want to test the integration of your code with the code written by other developers, e.g. some framework. Integration tests ensures that any abstractions we build over the third-party code work as expected. Both unit and integration tests are written by application developers. 


==== Functional Testing

Functional testing (or acceptance testing) is aimed at finding out whether the application properly implements business logic. For example, if the user clicks on a row in the customer data grid, the program should display a form view with specific details about the selected customer. In functional testing business users should define what has to be tested, unlike unit or integration testing where tests are created by software developers. Functional tests can be performed manually, in which a real person clicks through each and every view of the web application, confirming that it operates properly or reporting discrepancies with the functional specifications.

//TBD
// TODO Is Casper.js good example to demonstrate functional testing of app?
// http://casperjs.org/quickstart.html
// ... or Zombie.js http://zombie.labnotes.org/

==== Load Testing

Load testing is a process that can help in answering the following questions:

* How many concurrent users can work with your application without bringing your server to its knees? 
* Even if your server is capable of serving a thousand users, is your application performance in a compliance with the service level agreement (SLA), if any? 

//TBD

[[TDD]]
=== Test Driven Development

The methodology known as Test-Driven Development (TDD) substantially changes the way a "classic" software development is done. This methodology wants you to write tests _even before_ writing the application code. Instead of just using testing to verify our work _after it's done_, TDD moves the testing into the earlier application design phase. You should use the tests to clarify your ideas about what you are about to program. Here is fundamental mantra of TDD:

- Write a test and make it fail.
- Make the test pass.
- Refactor.
- Repeat.

This technique also referred as "Red-Green-Refactoring" because IDE's and test runners use red color to indicate failed test and green color to indicate passed tests.

When you are about to start programming a class with some business logic, ask yourself, "How can I ensure that this function works fine?" After you know the answer, write a test JavaScript class that calls this function _to assert_ that the business logic gives the expected result. 


An assertion is a true-false statement that represents what a programmer assumes about program state, e.g.  *customerID >0* is an assertion. 

According to Martin Fauler, an assertion is a sections of code work only if certain conditions are true (M.Fauler Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code, 2002 p.212). An assertion is a conditional statement that is assumed to be always true. Failure of an assertion results in test failure. 

Run your test, and it  will immediately fail because no application code is written yet! Only after the test is written, start programming the business logic of your application 

You should write a simplest possible piece of code to make the test pass. Don't try to find a generic solution at this step. For example, if you want to test calculator that needs to return `4` as result of `2+2` write the code what simply returns `4`. Don't worry about performance or optimization on this step. Just make the test pass. Once you made it, you can refactor your application code. Now you might want to introduce a real algorithm for implementing the application logic without worrying about breaking the  contract with other components of your application. 

A failed unit test indicates that your code change introduced regression, which is a new bug in a previously worked software. Automated testing and well-written test cases can reduce the likelihood of a regression in your code.

TDD allows to receive feedback from your code almost immediately. It's better to find that something is broken during development rather than in the application deployed in production.

// TODO - develop the idea of receiving feedback from code. http://vimeo.com/36579366

===============================
And learn by heart The Golden Rule Of TDD:

Never write new functionality without a failing test

Say, you want to test validation logic in Donation entry form.

In addition to business logic, web applications should be tested for proper rendering of UI components, changing view states, dispatching, and handling events.

==== Automate Everything

You should automate testing as much as you can to reduce the costs of building, deploying, and maintaining your application. 

Now lets start building the foundation for our refactored application. We are going to use the tasks running framework for the JavaScript project called http://gruntjs.com/[Grunt]. With Grunt's help we'll automate process of running tests once the code changes. The tests should help in assessing the quality of our code. You'll learn how to setup Grunt to watch your code changes and run tests right after you modified the code and saved the changes. 

With the Grunt tool you can have a script to run all your tests. In you came from the Java world, you know about Apache Ant, a general-purpose command-line tool for drive processes described in build files as targets. Grunt also running the tasks described in. There is a wide range of tasks available today - starting with running automated unit tests and ending with JavaScript code minification. Grunt provides a separate layer of abstraction where you can define tasks in special DSL (domain-specific language) in Gruntfile and Grunt will execute it.

===== The Simplest Grunt File

You can follow http://gruntjs.com/getting-started[instruction from official website] to install Grunt on your machine.

Let's start with the simplest Grunt project setup. The following two files must be present in the project directory:

* `package.json`: This file is used by npm (https://npmjs.org/[Node Package Manager]) to store metadata for projects. You will list Grunt and its plugins your project needs as devDependencies in this file.
* `Gruntfile`: This file is named `Gruntfile.js` or `Gruntfile.coffee` and is used to configure or define the tasks and load Grunt plugins.


.The simplest possible Gruntfile
[source,javascript]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
module.exports = function (grunt) {
    'use strict';

    grunt.registerTask('hello', 'say hello', function(){    // <1>
        grunt.log.writeln("Hello from grunt");              // <2>
    });
};
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Register the new task named `hello`.
<2> Print the greeting text using http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.log[grunt's log API]

Let's run this `hello` task with the command `grunt --gruntfile Grunt_simple.js hello`

[source,scala]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Running "hello" task
Hello from grunt

Done, without errors.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Test-driven development with Qunit

TBD

==== Behavior-Driven Development With Jasmine

The idea behind _behavior-driven development_ (BDD) is to use the "natural language" constructs to describe what you think your code should be doing, or more specifically, what your functions should be returning.

Similarly to unit tests, with BDD you write short specifications that test one thing at the time. Specifications should be sentences. For example, "Calculator adds two positive numbers". It will help you easy identify the failed test by simply reading this sentence in test results report. Now we'll demonstrate this concept using Jasmine, the BDD frameworks for JavaScript. Jasmine provides very nice way to group, execute, and report JavaScript unit tests. 

===== Setup Grunt with Jasmine

You've learned already how to use Grunt tool to automate boilerplate tasks. Next in this section we're going to show how you can execute a Jasmine specification with Grunt.

Let's start by downloading latest version of Jasmine from https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/downloads[official github repository]. Unzip the archive. Content of unzipped folder will be looking similar to screenshot <<FIG-1>>.

.Jasmine Distribution
[[FIG-1]]
image::images/fig_08_01.png["Jasmine distribution"]

Jasmine comes with example spec (+spec+ folder) and html test runner - +SpecRunner.html+. Let's open +SpecRunner.html+ in browser <<FIG-2>>. 

.Running Jasmine Specs in a Browser
[[FIG-2]]
image::images/fig_08_02.png["SpectRunner.html"]

+SpecRunner.html+ file is very similar to the qunit html runner. You can run specs by opening the runner file in browser.  

[source, html]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
include::include/SpecRunner.html[]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Required Jasmine framework library
<2> Include source files
<3> Include specs code
<4> Initialize Jasmine and run all specifications when the page is loaded

Now let's update our Grunfile to run the same sample specifications with the headless browser. For that we need to copy content of +src+ folder of your Jasmine distribution into the `app/js` folder of our project, and then copy the content of the `spec` folder into the `test/spec` folder of our project. Also create a folder `test/lib/jasmine` and copy there content of Jasmine distribution `lib` folder. <<FIG-3>>

.Jasmine Specifications in Our Project
[[FIG-3]]
image::images/fig_08_03.png[]

Now we need to edit the +Gruntfile.js+ to activate Jasmine support.

.+Gruntfile_jasmine.js+ with Jasmine running support 
[source,javascript]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
module.exports = function (grunt) {
    'use strict';

    grunt.initConfig({
        jasmine: {  // <1>
            src: ['app/js/Player.js', 'app/js/Song.js'], // <2> 
            options: {
                specs: 'test/spec/PlayerSpec.js',   // <3>
                helpers: 'test/spec/SpecHelper.js'  // <4>
            }
        }
    });

    // Alias the `test` task
    grunt.registerTask('test', 'jasmine');
    // loading jasmine grunt module
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jasmine');
};
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Configuring Jasmine task
<2> Specifying the location of the source files
<3> Location of Jasmine specs
<4> Location of Jasmine helpers (will be covered later in this chapter)

To execute tests, run the command `grunt --gruntfile Gruntfile_jasmine.js jasmine`, and you should see something like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Running "jasmine:src" (jasmine) task
Testing jasmine specs via phantom
.....
5 specs in 0.003s.
>> 0 failures

Done, without errors.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, Grunt successfully executed the tests with PhantomJS of all five specifications defined in PlayerSpec.js. In next section you will learn how write your own specifications.

===== Jasmine Basics

After we've set up the tools for running the tests let's start developing our tests and learn Jasmine framework constructs.

.Specifications Anatomy TODO
* `describe` - suite, `xdescribe` ->
* `it`  - specification, `xit` -> skip specification execution
* `expect` 
* matchers  - asserts (?). in details...
** Equality
** Identity
** Yes or No?
** Negate other matchers
** Is element present
** Nullness
** Comparator
** Custom matchers (and helpers files)
* Write Jasmine specs in test-first manner (write test -> test fail -> write implementation -> test pass -> refactor )
* `beforeEach` and `afterEach` -> execute code before and after each spec
* nested suites
* Spies (?)
