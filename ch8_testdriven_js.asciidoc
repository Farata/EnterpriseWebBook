== Test-Driven Development with JavaScript

To shorten the development cycle of your Web application you need to start testing it on the early stages of the project. It seems obvious, but many enterprise IT organizations haven't adopted the agile testing methodologies, which costs them dearly. JavaScript is dynamically typed interpreted language, which means that there is no compiler to help to identifying errors as it's done in compiled languages like Java. This means that a lot more time should be allocated for testing for JavaScript Web applications. Moreover, a programmer who didn't introduce unit testing techniques into his daily routine can't be 100% sure that his code is working properly.

The static code analysis and code quality tools such as http://esprima.org/[Esprima] and http://www.jshint.com/[JSHint] will help in reducing the number of syntax errors and improve the quality of your code. Later in this chapter we will demonstrate how to setup +JSHint+ for your JavaScript project and check your code for the syntax errors automatically. 

To switch to a test-driven development mode, make testing a part of your development process in its early stages rather than scheduling testing after the development cycle is complete.

Introduction of test-driven development may substantially improve you code quality. It is very important to receive the feedback about your code on a regular basis. That's why unit tests must be automated. Ideally, the tests should run as soon as you've changed the code. In this chapter we are going to introduce Grunt - the task runner tool - that can help you with automation of repetitive operations like running unit tests when the code changes. 

There are many testing frameworks in JavaScript world, and in this chapter we'll give you a brief overview of two of them: http://qunitjs.com/[Qunit] and http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/[Jasmine]. The main goal of each framework to is to test small pieces of code a.k.a. _units_.  We will also show how to abstract your JavaScript project lifecycle from any specific frameworks or libraries using Grunt tool.

We will go through the basic testing techniques such as "Test-driver development" and "Test First". You'll learn how to automate the testing process in multiple browsers with http://karma-runner.github.io/[Karma Runner] or by running tests in so called _headless_ mode with http://phantomjs.org/[PhantomJS]. You'll learn how to mock and stub selected artifacts of the environment (such as `XMLHTTPRequiest` object or timer) with http://sinonjs.org/[Sinon.js] and how to unit test the DOM manipulation code.

The second part of this chapter is dedicated to setting up a new Save Sick Child project in the IDE with selected test frameworks.

=== Why Testing

Any software has bugs. But in interpreted languages like JavaScript you don't have help of compilers that could have pointed you at the potential issues on early stages of development. You need to continue testing the code over and over again to catch regression errors, to be able to add new features without breaking the existing ones. The code covered with tests is easy to refactor. Tests help to prove correctness of your code. A well tested code leads to the better overall design of your programs.

=== Testing Basics

In this chapter we are going to discuss the following types of testing (we don't cover QA and UAT in this book):

- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Functional tests
- Load (a.k.a. stress) tests

Let's go over the strategies, approaches, and tools that will help you in automation of each of the above tests.

==== Unit Testing

The _unit test_ is a piece of code that invokes the method or class being tested. It _asserts_ some assumptions about the application logic and behavior of the  method or class. You'll be writing unit tests using a unit-testing framework. The test should run fast, be automated and readable. For example you can test that if a function is called with a particular arguments, it should return an expected result.
We will take a closer look on unit testing terminology and vocabulary in a <<TDD>> section.

==== Integration Testing

Integration testing is a phase when already tested units are combined into a module to test the interfaces between them. You may want to test the integration of your code with the code written by other developers, e.g. some framework. Integration tests ensures that any abstractions we build over the third-party code work as expected. Both unit and integration tests are written by application developers. 

==== Functional Testing

Functional testing (or acceptance testing) is aimed at finding out whether the application properly implements business logic. For example, if the user clicks on a row in the customer data grid, the program should display a form view with specific details about the selected customer. In functional testing business users should define what has to be tested, unlike unit or integration testing where tests are created by software developers. Functional tests can be performed manually, in which a real person clicks through each and every view of the web application, confirming that it operates properly or reporting discrepancies with the functional specifications.

//TBD
// TODO Is Casper.js good example to demonstrate functional testing of app?
// http://casperjs.org/quickstart.html
// ... or Zombie.js http://zombie.labnotes.org/

==== Load Testing

Load testing is a process that can help in answering the following questions:

* How many concurrent users can work with your application without bringing your server to its knees? 
* Even if your server is capable of serving a thousand users, is your application performance in a compliance with the service level agreement (SLA), if any? 


It all comes down to two factors: availability and response time of your application. Ideally, these requirements should be well defined in the Service Level Agreement (SLA) document, which should clearly state what's acceptable from the user's perspective.For example, the SLA can include a clause stating that the initial download of your application shouldn't take longer than 10 seconds for users with a slow connections (under 1Mbps). SLA can also state that the query to display a list of customers shouldn't run for more than five seconds, and the application should be operational 99.9 percent of the time.

To avoid surprises after going live with your new mission-critical web application, don't forget to include in your project plan an item to create and run a set of heavy stress tests, and do this well in advance before your project  goes live. You don't need to hire a thousand of interns play the roles of concurrent users to find out whether your application will meet the SLA requirements.

The automated load testing software allows you to emulate required number of users, set up the throttling to emulate a slower connection, and configure the ramp-up speed. For example, you can simulate a situation where the number of users logged on to your system grows at the speed of 50 users every 10 seconds.
Stress testing software also allows you to prerecord the action of the business users, and then you can run these scripts emulating a heavy load.

Professional stress-testing software allows simulating the load close to the real-world usage patterns. You should be able to create and run mixed scripts simulating a situation in which some users are logging on to your application while others are retrieving the data and performing data modifications.

[[TDD]]
=== Test Driven Development

The methodology known as Test-Driven Development (TDD) substantially changes the way a "classic" software development is done. This methodology wants you to write tests _even before_ writing the application code. Instead of just using testing to verify our work _after it's done_, TDD moves the testing into the earlier application design phase. You should use the tests to clarify your ideas about what you are about to program. Here is fundamental mantra of TDD:

- Write a test and make it fail.
- Make the test pass.
- Refactor.
- Repeat.

This technique also referred as "Red-Green-Refactoring" because IDE's and test runners use red color to indicate failed test and green color to indicate passed tests.

When you are about to start programming a class with some business logic, ask yourself, "How can I ensure that this function works fine?" After you know the answer, write a test JavaScript class that calls this function _to assert_ that the business logic gives the expected result. 

An assertion is a true-false statement that represents what a programmer assumes about program state, e.g.  *customerID >0* is an assertion. 

According to Martin Fauler, an assertion is a sections of code work only if certain conditions are true (M.Fauler Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code, 2002 p.212). An assertion is a conditional statement that is assumed to be always true. Failure of an assertion results in test failure. 

Run your test, and it  will immediately fail because no application code is written yet! Only after the test is written, start programming the business logic of your application 

You should write a simplest possible piece of code to make the test pass. Don't try to find a generic solution at this step. For example, if you want to test calculator that needs to return `4` as result of `2+2` write the code what simply returns `4`. Don't worry about performance or optimization on this step. Just make the test pass. Once you made it, you can refactor your application code. Now you might want to introduce a real algorithm for implementing the application logic without worrying about breaking the  contract with other components of your application. 

A failed unit test indicates that your code change introduced regression, which is a new bug in a previously worked software. Automated testing and well-written test cases can reduce the likelihood of a regression in your code.

TDD allows to receive feedback from your code almost immediately. It's better to find that something is broken during development rather than in the application deployed in production.

// TODO - develop the idea of receiving feedback from code. http://vimeo.com/36579366

[NOTE]
===============================
And learn by heart The Golden Rule Of TDD:
____
Never write new functionality without a failing test
____
===============================

Say, you want to test validation logic in Donation entry form.

//TODO - here should be code example with

In addition to business logic, web applications should be tested for proper rendering of UI components, changing view states, dispatching, and handling events.

With any testing framework, your tests will follow same basic pattern. First, you need to setup up the test environment. Second, you run the  production code and check that it works as it supposed to. 


Finally, you need to clean up after the test will run - remove everything that your program has created during setup of the environment.


[[AAAR]]This pattern for authoring unit tests is called _Arrange-Act-Assert_ (AAA footnote:[ http://integralpath.blogs.com/thinkingoutloud/2005/09/principles_of_t.html[Principles for Test-Driven Development] ]).

In the _Arrange_ phase you set up the unit of work to test. For example, create a DOM element.

In the _Act_ phase you exercise the unit under test and capture the  resulting state. You execute your production code in unit test context.

In the _Assert_ phase you verify the behavior through assertions.

There is one more phase: _Reset_. In this phase, if needed, you reset the environment to the initial state. For example, erase the DOM elements created in the _Arrange_ phase.

Later in this chapter, you'll see how different frameworks implements _AAAR_ pattern.


==== Automate Everything

You should automate testing as much as you can to reduce the costs of building, deploying, and maintaining your application. 

Now lets start building the foundation for our refactored application. We are going to use the tasks running framework for the JavaScript project called http://gruntjs.com/[Grunt]. With Grunt's help we'll automate process of running tests once the code changes. The tests should help in assessing the quality of our code. You'll learn how to setup Grunt to watch your code changes and run tests right after you modified the code and saved the changes. 

With the Grunt tool you can have a script to run all your tests. In you came from the Java world, you know about Apache Ant, a general-purpose command-line tool for drive processes described in build files as targets. Grunt also running the tasks described in. There is a wide range of tasks available today - starting with running automated unit tests and ending with JavaScript code minification. Grunt provides a separate layer of abstraction where you can define tasks in special DSL (domain-specific language) in Gruntfile and Grunt will execute it.

===== The Simplest Grunt File

You can follow http://gruntjs.com/getting-started[instruction from official website] to install Grunt on your machine.

Let's start with the simplest Grunt project setup. The following two files must be present in the project directory:

* `package.json`: This file is used by npm (https://npmjs.org/[Node Package Manager]) to store metadata for projects. You will list Grunt and its plugins your project needs as devDependencies in this file.

* `Gruntfile`: This file is named `Gruntfile.js` or `Gruntfile.coffee` and is used to configure or define the tasks and load Grunt plugins.

.The simplest possible Gruntfile
[source,javascript]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
module.exports = function (grunt) {
    'use strict';

    grunt.registerTask('hello', 'say hello', function(){    // <1>
        grunt.log.writeln("Hello from grunt");              // <2>
    });

    grunt.registerTask('default', 'hello');                 // <3>              
};
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Register a new task named `hello`.

<2> Print the greeting text using http://gruntjs.com/api/grunt.log[grunt's log API]

<3> With `grunt.registerTask` we define a default task to run when Grunt is called without any parameters. 

Each task can be called separately from the command line by passing the task's name as a command line parameter: For example `grunt hello` would only execute the task named hello from the above script.

Let's run this `hello` task with the following command 
`grunt --gruntfile Grunt_simple.js hello`.

[source,bash]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Running "hello" task
Hello from grunt

Done, without errors.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

==== Test-Driven Development With QUnit

We'll start our journey to JavaScript testing frameworks with http://qunitjs.com/[QUnit], which was originally developed by http://ejohn.org/about/[John Resig] as part of jQuery. QUnit now runs completely standalone and doesn't have any jQuery dependency. While it's still being used by the jQuery Project itself for testing jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile code, QUnit can be used to test any generic JavaScript code.

===== Setup Grunt With Qunit

WARNING: Section is in active development

In this section you're going learn how to automatically run the Qunit tests using Grunt. Let's setup our project by adding the Qunit framework and tests file. We'll start with downloading the latest version from http://qunitjs.com/[QUint Web site]. We need to get only two files - `qunit-*.js` and `qunit-*.css`.

test("my first qunit test", function () {
    ok(2 + 2 === 4, "Passed!");
});

We'll also need a test runner for the test setup.

<1> A test runner is an html file contains links to QUnit framework JavaScript file.

<2> In this chapter we continue working on the jQuery-based version of the Save Sick Child application. Hence our "production environment" depends on availability of jQuery, so we need to include jQuery in the test runner.

<3> Test files are included too.

<4> QUnit fills this block with results.

<5> Any HTML you want to be present in each test. It will be reset for each test.

To run all our tests we need to open the `qunit-runner.html` in browser.

        }
    });
    grunt.registerTask("test", "qunit");
    grunt.loadNpmTasks("grunt-contrib-qunit");
};

         strictEqual(actual, expected, [message])
         notStrictEqual(actual, expected, [message])
         throws(block, [expected], [message])


==== Behavior-Driven Development With Jasmine

The idea behind _behavior-driven development_ (BDD) is to use the "natural language" constructs to describe what you think your code should be doing, or more specifically, what your functions should be returning.

Similarly to unit tests, with BDD you write short specifications that test one thing at the time. Specifications should be sentences. For example, "Calculator adds two positive numbers". It will help you easy identify the failed test by simply reading this sentence in test results report. Now we'll demonstrate this concept using Jasmine, the BDD frameworks for JavaScript. Jasmine provides very nice way to group, execute, and report JavaScript unit tests. 

// TBD

===== Setup Grunt with Jasmine

You've learned already how to use Grunt tool to automate boilerplate tasks. Next in this section we're going to show how you can execute a Jasmine specification with Grunt. We'll cover the Jasmine basic in the next section, but for now think of Jasmine as a piece of code that should be executed by Grunt.

Let's start by downloading latest version of Jasmine from https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/downloads[official github repository]. Unzip the archive. Content of unzipped folder will be looking similar to screenshot <<FIG-1>>.

.Jasmine Distribution
[[FIG-1]]
image::fig_08_01.png["Jasmine distribution"]

Jasmine comes with example spec (+spec+ folder) and html test runner - +SpecRunner.html+. Let's open +SpecRunner.html+ in browser <<FIG-2>>. 

.Running Jasmine Specs in a Browser
[[FIG-2]]
image::fig_08_02.png["SpectRunner.html"]

+SpecRunner.html+ file is very similar to the qunit html runner. You can run specs by opening the runner file in browser.  

[source, html]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
include::include/SpecRunner.html[]
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Required Jasmine framework library
<2> Include source files
<3> Include specs code
<4> Initialize Jasmine and run all specifications when the page is loaded

Now let's update our Grunfile to run the same sample specifications with the headless browser. For that we need to copy content of +src+ folder of your Jasmine distribution into the `app/js` folder of our project, and then copy the content of the `spec` folder into the `test/spec` folder of our project. Also create a folder `test/lib/jasmine` and copy there content of Jasmine distribution `lib` folder. <<FIG-3>>

.Jasmine Specifications in Our Project
[[FIG-3]]
image::fig_08_03.png[]

Now we need to edit the +Gruntfile.js+ to activate Jasmine support.

.+Gruntfile_jasmine.js+ with Jasmine running support 
[source,javascript]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
module.exports = function (grunt) {
    'use strict';

    grunt.initConfig({
        jasmine: {  // <1>
            src: ['app/js/Player.js', 'app/js/Song.js'], // <2> 
            options: {
                specs: 'test/spec/PlayerSpec.js',   // <3>
                helpers: 'test/spec/SpecHelper.js'  // <4>
            }
        }
    });

    // Alias the `test` task
    grunt.registerTask('test', 'jasmine');
    // loading jasmine grunt module
    grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-jasmine');
};
----------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> Configuring Jasmine task
<2> Specifying the location of the source files
<3> Location of Jasmine specs
<4> Location of Jasmine helpers (will be covered later in this chapter)

To execute tests, run the command `grunt --gruntfile Gruntfile_jasmine.js jasmine`, and you should see something like this:

[source,bash]
----
Running "jasmine:src" (jasmine) task
Testing jasmine specs via phantom
.....
5 specs in 0.003s.
>> 0 failures

Done, without errors.
----

In this example, Grunt successfully executed the tests with PhantomJS of all five specifications defined in +PlayerSpec.js+. 

.What is PhantomJS?
****
PhantomJS is a headless WebKit-based rendering engine with JavaScript API.  Think of PhantomJS as a browser that doesn't have any graphical user interface. PhantomJS can execute HTML, CSS, JavaScript code. Because PhantomJS is not required to render GUI, it can be used in display-less environments (e.g.  Continuous Integration server) to run tests. In our case, Grunt automatically spawns PhantomJS instance, executes the code of our tests, reads the execution results using PhantomJS API, and prints them out in the console.
****

.What is Continuous Integration?
****
Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, which results in multiple integrations per day.
Introduced by Martin Fowler and Matthew Foemmel, the theory of continuous integration footnote:[http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html[Continuous Integration by Martin Fowler]] recommends creating scripts and running automated builds (including tests) of your application at least once a day.
This allows you to identify issues in the code early.

The authors of this book successfully use an open source framework called http://jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins] (there are other similar CI servers) for establishing continuous build process.

With Jenkins, you can have scripts that run either at a specified time interval or on each source code repository check-in of the new code. You may also force an additional build process whenever you like. The Grunt command line tool should be installed and be available on CI machine to allow the Jenkins server invoke Grunt scrips and publish test results.

// TODO: Add screenshot with grunt-based job for savesickchild.org website + test results 

We use it to ensure continuous builds of the internal and open source projects.

In the next section you will learn how write your own specifications.

===== Jasmine Basics

After we've set up the tools for running tests, let's start developing tests and learn the Jasmine framework constructs. Every specification file has a set of _suites_ defined in the `describe` function. Suites help logically organize code of test specifications. 

.ExampleSpec.js
[source,javascript]
----
describe("My function under test should", function () {     // <1>
    it("return on", function () {                           // <2>
        // place specification code here
        //
    });
    describe("another suite", function () {                   // <3>
        it("spec1", function () {

        });
    });
    it("my another spec", function () {                    // <4>
        var truth = true;
        expect(truth).toBeTruthy();
    });
    it("2+2 = 4", function () {
        expect(2 + 2).toEqual(4);                       // <5>
    });
});
----

<1> The function `describe` accepts two parameters - the name of the test suite, and the callback function. The function is a block of code that implements the suite. If for some reasons you would like to skip the suite from execution you can just use method `xdescribe` and a whole suite will be excluded until you rename it back to `describe`.

<2> The function `it` also accepts similar parameters - the name of the test specification, and the function that implements this specification. Like in case with suites, Jasmine has a corresponding `xit` method to exclude specification from execution.

<3> Each suite can have any number of nested suites.

<4> Each suite can have any number of specifications.

<5> The code checks to see if `2+2` equals `4`. We used the function `toEqual()`, which is a _matcher_. Define expectations with the function `expect`, which takes a value, called the actual. It's chained with a Matcher function, which takes the expected value (in our case it's 4) and checks if it satisfies the criterion defined in the matcher. Various flavors of matchers are shipped with Jasmine framework, and we're going to review a couple the frequently used matchers functions.

* Equality
+

Function `toEqual()` checks if two things are equal.

* True or False?
+

Functions `toBeTruthy()` and `toBeFalsy()` checks if something is true or false respectively.

* Identity
+

Function `toBe()` checks if two things are _the same object_.

* Nullness
+

Function `toBeNull()` checks if something is +null+.

* Is Element Present
+

Function `toContain()` check if an actual value is an element of array.
+

[source, javascript]
----
expect(["James Bond", "Austin Powers", "Jack Reacher", "Duck"]).toContain("Duck");
----

* Negate Other Matchers
+

This function is used to reverse matchers to ensure that they aren't +true+. To do that, simply prefix things with `.not`:
+

[source, javascript]
----
expect(["James Bond", "Austin Powers", "Jack Reacher"]).not.toContain("Duck");
----

Above we've listed only some of existing matchers. You can find the complete documentation with code examples at http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/#section-Matchers[official Jasmine website] and at https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine/wiki/Matchers[wiki].

===== Specification Setup

Jasmine framework has an API to arrange your specification (see <<AAAR>>). It includes two methods - `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()`, which allow you to execute some code before and after each spec respectively. It's very useful for instantiation of the shared objects or cleaning up after the tests complete.
If you need to fulfill your test with some common dependencies or setup the environment, just place code inside `beforeEach()` method. Such dependencies and environment are known as _fixture_.

****
*What is Fixture?*
Test fixture refers to the fixed state used as a baseline for running tests. The main purpose of a test fixture is to ensure that there is a well known and fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. Sometimes a fixture also referred as _test context_.

----

<1> This method will be called before each specification.

<2> In the `beforeEach()` method we create two input fields. These two inputs will be available in all specifications of this suite.

<3> You can place additional cleanup code inside `afterEach()` function.

<4> A `beforeEach()` function helps to implement _Don't Repeat Yourself_ principle in our tests. You don't need to create the dependency elements inside each specification manually.

<5> You can change defaults inside each specification without worrying about  affecting other specifications. Your test environment will be reset for each specification.


===== Custom Matchers

Jasmine framework is easily extendable, and it allows you to define your own matchers if for some reasons you're unable to find the appropriate matchers in the Jasmine distribution. In such cases you'd need to write a custom matcher. Let's write a matcher that check if a string contains name of the "secret agent" from the defined list of agents. 

// TBD

.Custom `toBeSecretAgent` matcher
[source,javascript]
----
beforeEach(function () {
    this.addMatchers({
        toBeSecretAgent: function () {
            var agentList = [
                "James Bond",
                "Ethan Hunt",
                "Jason Bourne",
                "Aaron Cross",
                "Jack Reacher"
            ];

            var actual = this.actual;               // <1>
            this.message = function () {            // <2>
                return actual + " is not a secret agent";
            };
            return agentList.indexOf(actual) !== -1;    // <3> 
        }
    });
});
----

<1> `this.actual` contains the value used as arguments in the `expect` function.

<2> We can customize error message if the test fails.

<3> This function checks if `agentsList` contains the actual value.

The invocations of this helper can look like this:

[source,javascript]
----
it("part of super agents", function () {
    expect("James Bond").toBeSecretAgent();         // <1>
    expect("Jason Bourne").toBeSecretAgent();
    expect("Austin Powers").not.toBeSecretAgent();  // <2>
    expect("Austin Powers").toBeSecretAgent();     // <3>
});
----

<1> Calling the custom matcher.

<2> Custom matchers could be used together with the `.not` modifier.

<3> This expectation will fail because 'Austin Powers' is not in the list of secret agents.

The following custom failure message will be displayed on the console.
    
[source,bash]
----
/usr/local/share/npm/bin/grunt --gruntfile Gruntfile_jasmine.js jasmine
Running "jasmine:src" (jasmine) task
Testing jasmine specs via phantom
...........x

>> 1 failures
Warning: Task "jasmine:src" failed. Use --force to continue.

Aborted due to warnings.
----

<1> A custom failure message. Also, the failed `expect` was the fourth one (4) according to the order mentioned in spec.

===== Spies


Test spies are objects and functions that record information about their usage through the systems under test. They are useful when determining a function's success is not easily accomplished by inspecting its return value or changes to the state of objects with witch it interacts.

    
.Specifications Anatomy TODO
* Write Jasmine specs in test-first manner (write test -> test fail -> write implementation -> test pass -> refactor )

===== BDD Best Practices

// TBD
// Organize Tests As If Reading a Story
// Test method names should be sentences
// Developers discovered it could do at least some of their documentation for them, so they started to write test methods that were real sentences. What's more, they found that when they wrote the method name in the language of the business domain, the generated documents made sense to business users, analysts, and testers.

// A simple sentence template keeps test methods focused 

// An expressive test name is helpful when a test fails 

==== Multi-Browser Testing With Karma

In the previous section of this chapter we showed you how to execute your test and specification in headless mode using PhantomJS, which is very useful for running tests in the Continuous Integration environments. While PhantomJS is based on the WebKit rendering engine, there are browsers that don't use WebKit. It's obvious that running tests manually in each browser is tedious and not productive.

To automate testing in all Web browsers, you can use Karma framework (previously known as _Testacular_). In this section we will show how to configure Karma and integrate it with Grunt.

===== Karma Configuration file

Karma runner is driven by a configuration file.

// TBD

.A Simple Karma Configuration File
[source,javascript]
----
basePath = '';      // <1>

files = [           // <2>
  JASMINE,
  JASMINE_ADAPTER,
    "app/js/*.js",
    "test/spec/*.js"
];

exclude = [         // <3>
    "app/js/main.js",
    "test/spec/introduction.js"
];

browsers = ['Chrome', 'ChromeCanary', 'PhantomJS', 'Safari', 'Firefox', 'Opera']; // <4>

singleRun = true; //<5>
----

<1> A path that will be used to resolve the location of the files <2> and exclude <3>

<2> An array of the file names to load in the browser

<3> An array of the file names to be excluded from loading

<4> An array of the browser names to be used to execute JavaScript code

<5> If this property is equal to `true` than Karma will start the browsers, run the tests, and exit.

===== Running Tests 

// TBD

.Gruntfile with karma task
[source,javascript]
----
module.exports = function(grunt) {
  "use strict";  
  grunt.initConfig({
    karma: {                        // <1>
      unit: {
        configFile: 'test/runner/karma_min.conf.js' // <2>
      }
    }
  });
  grunt.loadNpmTasks("grunt-karma");
};
----
<1> TheKarma task is defined in the grunt config.

<2> The name of the configuration file for the Karma task.

Now we can run our test simultaneously on all browsers that we have installed in  our computer - Google Chrome (+ Canary version), Safari, Firefox, Opera and PhantomJS - with one command:

`grunt karma`.

// TBD

[source,bash]

==== Testing DOM

Document Object Model is a standard browser API that allows a developer to access and manipulate page elements. As you have seen in previous chapters, pretty often your JavaScript code needs to access and manipulate the HTML page elements in some way. Testing the DOM is the crucial part of testing your client side JavaScript. 
By design, DOM is a browser-agnostic API. But in the real world, if you want to make sure that your code works in the particular browser you need to run the test inside this browser.

Earlier in this chapter we've introduced the Jasmine method `beforeEach()`, which is the right place for setting all required DOM elements and making them available in the specifications.

.Using jQuery APIs to create the required DOM elements before run the spec
[[FIX-1]]
[source,javascript]
----
describe("spec", function() {
    var usernameInput;
    beforeEach(function() { // <1>
        usernameInput = $(document.createElement("input")).attr({ // <2>
            type: 'text',
            id: 'username',
            name: 'username'
        })[0];
    });
});
----
<1> Inside the `beforeEach()` method we're using the API to manipulate the DOM programatically. Also, if you're using an HTML test runner you can add the fixture using HTML tags. But we don't recommend this approach. Very soon you will find your HTML test runner will become unmaintainable because it's going to get clogged with tons of fixture HTML code.

<2> Create an `<input>` element using jQuery APIs, which will turn into the following HTML:   

[source,html]
----
<input type=​"text" id=​"password" name=​"password" placeholder=​"password" autocomplete=​"off">​
----

The jQuery API is more convenient than a plain DOM API. But in the future examples we will use the https://github.com/searls/jasmine-fixture[jasmine-fixture] library for easier setup of the DOM fixture. Jasmine-fixture uses similar to jQuery selectors syntax for injecting HTML fixtures. With this library you will significantly decrease the amount of repetitive code while creating the fixtures.

// TODO: add jasmine-fixture setup, how to download and add to jasmine Grunts's task

Let's see how the example from <<FIX-1,previous code snippet>> looks like with the jasmine-fixture library.

.Using jasmine-fixture to setup the DOM before spec run
[source,javascript]
----
describe("spec", function() {
    var usernameInput;
    beforeEach(function() {
        usernameInput = affix('input[id="username"][type="text"][name="username]')[0]; // <1>
    });

    it("should not allow login with empty username and password and return code equals 0", function() {
        var result = ssc.login(usernameInput, passwordInput); // <2>
        expect(result).toBe(0);
    });
});
----
<1> Using the `affix()` function provided by the jasmine-fixture library and expressiveness of CSS selectors we can easily setup required DOM elements. More examples of possible selectors could be found at the https://github.com/searls/jasmine-fixture#more-examples[documentation page] of jasmine-fixture.

<2> Now when all requirements for our production code (`login()` function) are satisfied we can run it in the context of a test and assert the results.

As you can see, testing of the DOM manipulation code is much like any other type of unit testing. You need to prepare a fixture (a.k.a. the testing context), run the production code and assert the results.

// TBD using spies to mock code related to interaction with server

=== Save Sick Child With TDD

TBD...  

=== Summary

Testing is one of the most important processes of software development. Well organized testing helps keeping the code of an application in a good and working state. Especially, it's important in interpreted languages like JavaSctipt where there is no compiler to provide a helping hand to find lots of errors on very early stages. In enterprise projects written in compiled languages people often debate if testing is really needed. With JavaScript it's non-debatable unless you have an unlimited time and budget and are ready to live with unmaintainable JavaScript. 

The enterprises that have adopted test-driven development (as well as behavior-driven development) can make the application development process more bulletproof by including test scripts in the continuous integration build process. If automatically launched unit, integration, functional, and load test scripts don't reveal any issues, you can rest assured that the latest code changes did not break the application logic, and that it performs according to the SLA.
