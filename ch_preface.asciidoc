== Preface

This book should help Web application developers and software architects in picking the right strategy for developing cross-platform applications that run on a variety of desktop computers as well as mobile devices. Primary audience is developers who are in a large organization and need to learn how to develop Web application using HTML5 stack.

This book has the word _Enterprise_ in its title, and we'll explain you what we consider _enterprise applications_ by giving you some examples. Creating a Web application that will process orders is not the same as creating a Web site to publish blogs. Enterprise applications include company-specific workflows, and usually they need to be integrated with number of internal systems, data sources and processes.

Google Doc is not an enterprise Web application. But Google appliance integrating search operating on company documents, databases, processes, tickets, and providing collaboration is - it integrates
consumer-workforce front office with what the company does (back office).

Google Maps is not an enterprise application. But Google Maps integrated with the company site used by insurance agents to plan daily route, scheduling, doing address verification and geo-coding is.

Just using a Web application in some business doesn't make it an enterprise Web application. If you take Gmail as is, it won't be an enterprise application until you integrate it into another process of your business.

Is an online game an enterprise application? It depends on the game. A multi-player online roulette game hooked up to a payment system, and maintaining users' accounts is an enterprise Web application. But
playing Sudoku online doesn't feel too enterprisey.

How about a dating Web site? If the site just offers an ability to display singles - it's just a publishing site as there is not much of a business there. Can you turn a dating Web site into an enterprise application? It's possible.

Some people will argue that an enterprise application must supports multiple users, high data load, include data grids and dashboards, be scalable, have business and persistence layers, offer professional support et al. This is correct, but we don't believe that a Web application should do all this to qualify for the adjective _enterprise_.

Let's create a simple definition of an enterprise Web application:

"An enterprise Web application is the one that helps an organization running its business online".

In this book we are going to build a sample Save the Child Web application that will allow people to register, donate, find local kids that need help, match donors and recipients, upload images, videos and display
statistics. Would these feature make Save the Child an enterprise Web application? Yes, as it can help our imaginary non-for-profit organization to run its business: collecting donations for ill kids. As a matter of fact, the company that employs authors of this book has a client that is a similar non-for-profit organization that is in business of helping people fighting a certain disease.


=== Why the Authors Wrote the book

The authors of this book have ninety years of combined experience in development of enterprise applications. During all these years we've been facing the same challenges regardless of what programming language we use:

* How to make the application code base maintainable
* How to make the application responsive by modularizing its code base
* How to minimize the number of the production issues by proper testing on earlier stages of the project life cycle
* How to design UI that looks good and is convenient for users
* Which frameworks or libraries to pick
* Which design patterns to apply in coding

This list can be easily extended. Ten years ago we've been developing UI mainly in Java, five years ago in Adobe Flex, today in HTML5-related technologies. This book is an attempt to share with the readers our understanding of how to approach the above challenges in HTML5.

=== Who This Book is For

Web application development with HTML5 includes HTML, JavaScript, CSS and dozens of JavaScript frameworks. The main goal of this book is to give you a hands-on overview of development Web applications that can be run on a variety devices - desktops, tablets and smartphones. We expect the reader to have some experience with any programming language. Knowledge of basic HTML is also required. Understanding of the principles of object-oriented programming would be helpful too.

This book is intended for software developers, team leaders, and Web application architects who want to learn the following:

* How to program in JavaScript language 
* How to write Web applications using some of the popular libraries and frameworks     
* How to modularize the client's side of Web applications written in JavaScript
* How to test Web applications
* Is applying _responsive design_ principles the right strategy for your application
* Which security vulnerabilities to watch for
* Why developing for mobile devices differs from developing for desktops 
* What are the pros and cons of developing mobile application using HTML5 stack versus native languages 

 
=== What the Book is And Why it's Important

This book has a lot of breadth, but for mastering some of the topics in depth be prepare to do additional studying. On the other hand, we give you a lot of working code samples to those who prefer studying by reading code.

This book can be important for busy professionals who don't have time for reading a separate book about each and every library and framework that exist in the HTML5 universe. This book will help them to narrow down the list of technologies and frameworks to be considered for the next project.

Enterprise server-side developers will also benefit from reading this book. Pretty often enterprise Java or .Net developers feel caught off guard when they get a task to create a new Web application with the cross-platform and cross-browser UI. These strong enterprise developers with good business knowledge  may not have enough exposure to how things work in HTML5 domain. This book can be a time saver for all server-side developers who need to start working on the front end of Web applications.

Finally, this book is important because of the way it's written - you'll be working on the application that's introduced next.

=== Introducing Save The Child Application 

To make this book more practical, we decided to not just give you the unrelated code snippets illustration various syntax or techniques, but but bring all of them together in a working application (just the UI portion).  While learning various frameworks, libraries and approaches to building UI for Web application you'll be writing multiple versions of the same Web application - Save The Child. It's a sample charity application that may be used to collect donations for children who need medical attention.

First we'll show how to build this application in HTML/JavaScript, then we'll re-write it using jQuery library, then with Ext JS framework. The users will be able to see where different charity events are being run (Google maps integration). The page will integrate the video player and display the chart  with stats on donors by geographical location. One of the versions shows how to modularize this application - this is a must for any enterprise system. Another version shows how to use WebSockets technology to illustrate the server-side data push while adding an auction to this Web application. The final four chapters of the book show different ways of building different version of the same Save The Child application to run on mobile devices (Responsive Design, jQuery Mobile, Sencha Touch, and PhoneGap). We believe that this application will help you in comparing all these approaches and selecting those that fit your objectives.

=== What the Goals of the Book Are

First, we want to say what's not the goal of this book. We are not planning to convince you that developing a cross-platform Web application is the right strategy for you. Don't be surprised if after reading this book you'll decide that developing applications in HTML5 is not the right approach for the tasks you have at hands. 

This book should help decision makers in picking the right strategy for developing cross-platform applications that run on a variety of desktop computers as well as mobile devices. 

=== Technologies Used in This Book

This is HTML5 book, and the main programming language used here is JavaScript. We use HTML and CSS too. Most of the modern JavaScript development is done using various libraries and frameworks. The difference between a library and a framework is that the former does not dictate how to structure the code of your application - they simply offer a set of components that will spare you from writing lots of manual code. The goal of some frameworks is to help developers with testing of their applications. The goal of some frameworks is just to split the application into separate modules. There are tools just for building, packaging and running JavaScript  applications. While many of the frameworks and tools will be mentioned in this book, the main technologies/libraries/tools/techniques/protocols used in this book are listed below:

* jQuery
* jQuery Mobile
* Ext JS
* Sencha Touch
* RequireJS
* Jasmine
* WebSocket
* PhoneGap
* Grunt

Although you can write your programs in any text editor, using specialized Integrated Development Environments is more productive, and we'll use Aptana Studio IDE by Appcelerator and WebStorm IDE by JetBrains.

=== How the Book is Organized 

Even though you may decide not to read some of the chapters we still recommend you to skim through them.
Chapters 1, 3, and 4 are must read - if you can't read JavaScript code or are not familiar with CSS, AJAX or JSON, the rest of the book will be difficult to understand. On the other hand, if you're not planning to use, say Ext JS framework, you can just skim through Chapter 6. Following is a brief book outline:

*Introduction* includes a brief discussion of what's the difference between enterprise Web applications and Web sites. It also touches upon the evolution of HTML. 

*Chapter 1*  is an introduction to programming with JavaScript. In about 60 pages we've covered main aspects of this language. No matter what framework you choose, a working knowledge the JavaScript is required.  

*Chapter 2* is a brief overview of selected APIs from  HTML5 specification. They are supported by all modern Web browsers. We find these APIs important and useful for many Web applications. The following API will be reviewed in this chapter:

* Web Messaging
* Web Workers
* Application Cache
* Local Storage
* Indexed Database
* History API

*Chapter 3* describes the process of mocking up the application Save The Child, which will support donations to the children, embed a video player, integrate with Google maps, and eventually will feature an online auction. We'll show you how to gradually build all the functionality of this Web application while explaining each step of the way. By the end of this chapter we'll have the Web design and the first prototype of the Save The Child application written using just HTML, JavaScript and CSS.

*Chapter 4* is about bringing external data to Web browsers by making asynchronous calls to server. The code from previous chapters uses only hard-coded data. Now it's time to learn how to make asynchronous server calls using AJAX techniques and consume the data in JSON format. The Save The Child application will start requesting the data from the external sources and sending them the JSON-formatted data. 

*Chapter 5* shows how to use a popular jQuery library to lower the amount of manual coding in the Save The Child application. First, we'll introduce the jQuery Core library, and then re-build our Save The Child application with it. In the real world, developers often increase their productivity by using JavaScript libraries and frameworks. 

*Chapter 6* is a mini tutorial of a comprehensive JavaScript framework called Ext JS. This is one of the most feature-complete frameworks available on the market. Sencha, the company behind Ext JS, managed to extend JavaScript to make its syntax closer to classical object-oriented languages. They also developed and extensive library of the UI components. Expect to see another re-write of the Save The child here.  

*Chapter 7* explains how to modularize large applications. Reducing the application startup latency and implementing lazy loading of certain parts of the application are the main reasons for modularization. We'll give you an example of how to build modularized Web applications that won't bring the large and monolithic code to the client's machine, but will rather load the code on as needed basis. You'll also see how to organize the data exchange between different programming modules in a loosely coupled fashion. The Save The Child application will be re-written with RequireJS framework, which will be loading modules on demand rather than the entire application. 

*Chapter 8* is dedicated to test-driven development with JavaScript. To shorten the development cycle of your Web application you need to start testing it on the early stages of the project. It seems obvious, but many enterprise IT organizations haven’t adopted agile testing methodologies, which costs them dearly. JavaScript is dynamically typed interpreted language - there is no compiler to help in identifying errors as it’s done in compiled languages like Java. This means that a lot more time should be allocated for testing for JavaScript Web applications. We'll cover the basics of testing and will introduce to to some of the popular testing frameworks for JavaScript application. Finally, you'll see how to test Save The Child application with Jasmine framework. 

*Chapter 9* shows how to substantially speedup the interaction between the client and the server using  WebSocket protocol introduced in HTML5. HTTP adds a lot of overhead for every request and response object that serve as wrappers for the data. You'll see how to introduce the WebSocket-based online auction to the new version of our Save The Child application. This is what Ian Hickson, the HTML5 spec editor from Google, said about why WebSocket protocol is important: 

"Reducing kilobytes of data to 2 bytes is more than a little more byte efficient, and reducing latency from 150ms (TCP round trip to set up the connection plus a packet for the message) to 50ms (just the packet for the message) is far more than marginal. In fact, these two factors alone are enough to make WebSocket seriously interesting to Google.

*Chapter 10* is a brief introduction to Web application security. You'll learn about vulnerabilities of Web applications and will get references to the documents that contain  recommendations on how to protect your application from attackers. This chapter concludes with some of the application-specific security considerations like the regulatory compliance that your business customers can't ignore.  

*Chapter 11* opens up a discussion of how to approach creating Web applications that should run not only on desktops, but also on mobile devices. In this chapter you'll get familiar with the principles of responsive design, which allows to have a single code base that will be flexible enough to render the UI that looks good on the large and small screens. You'll see the power of CSS _media queries_ that will automatically re-allocate the UI components based on the screen width. The new version of the Save The Child application will demonstrate how to go about responsive design.

*Chapter 12* will introduce you to jQuery Mobile - the library that was specifically created for developing mobile Web applications. But main principles implemented in the larger jQuery library remain in place, and studying the materials from Chapter 5 is a prerequisite for the understanding of this chapter. Then you'll be creating the mobile version of the Save The Child with jQuery Mobile.

*Chapter 13* is about a little brother of Ext JS - Sencha Touch framework. This framework was developed for the mobile devices, and you'll need to read  Chapter 6 to be able to understand the materials from this one. As usual, we'll develop another version of the mobile version of the Save The Child with Sencha Touch.

*Chapter 14* shows how you can create hybrid mobile applications, which are written with HTML/JavaScript/CSS, but can use the native API of the mobile devices. Hybrids are packaged as native mobile applications and can be submitted to the popular online app stores or market places the same way as if they were written in the programming language native for the mobile platform in question. This chapter will illustrate how to access the camera of the mobile device using the PhoneGap framework.
